易用性第一准则？ 别听用户的

First Rule of Usability? Don't Listen to Users

易用性第一准则？ 别听用户的Jakob Nielsen

翻译：机械化研究所Summary:

To design an easy-to-use interface, pay attention to what users do, not what they say. Self-reported claims are unreliable, as are user speculations about future behavior.

要易于使用的界面，需要关心用户做什么，而不是他们说什么。自我报告的要求都是不可靠的，就好比要用户对未来的行为进行推测。In past years, the greatest usability barrier was the preponderance of cool design. Most projects were ruled by usability opponents who preferred complexity over simplicity. As a result, billions of dollars were wasted on flashy designs that were difficult to use.

在过去的几年中，易用性最大的障碍是被所谓的酷设计所左右，大部分项目实际上都被易用性的相反一面———把事情作的更复杂，而不是更简单--所左右。结果就是，数以亿计的资金都被花在了那些看起来很炫，但是实际上很难用的设计上去了。One of the main advantages of the "dot-bomb" downturn is that cool design has suffered a severe set back. Companies are now focused on the bottom line:

网络泡沫破灭的一个主要收益是那些酷设计遭到了推迟或下马，各公司目前主要聚焦在如下一些内容上：Public websites, which formerly focused on building awareness, now aim at making it easy for customers to do business.

公共网站，一般主要的目的在于建立知名度，现在开始聚焦于让客户容易的开展业务Intranets are similarly refocused on improving employee productivity. Many companies are attempting to create order, impose design standards, and enhance navigation on previously chaotic intranets.

企业内部网：类似的也开始聚焦于如何提高雇员的生产率，大多数公司开始建立规范的和强制的设计标准规范，并增强以前混乱的内部网应用的导航

Happily, glamour-based design has lost and usability advocates have won the first and hardest victory: Companies are now paying attention to usability needs.

很令人高兴，以美观和漂亮为重心的设计失去市场，易用性的提倡者赢得了第一个也是最艰苦的而一个胜利：公司现在开始关注易用性的需求了。

Unfortunately, winning a battle with usability opponents doesn't win the war with complexity. It simply moves us to a new front line: The battle is now to get companies to do usability right.

很不幸的是，在易用性对立面上赢得的战役胜利，并不能赢得和复杂性战争的胜利。它很轻易的就把我们送到了一个新的前线：这个战斗是要让公司“正确”的来做易用性。Watch Users Work

观察用户工作

Too frequently, I hear about companies basing their designs on user input obtained through misguided methods. A typical example? Create a few alternative designs, show them to a group of users, and ask which one they prefer. Wrong. If the users have not actually tried to use the designs, they'll base their comments on surface features. Such input often contrasts strongly with feedback based on real use.

我非常频繁的听说，公司经常基于用错误方法获取的用户输入来进行设计。要举个典型的例子？建立一些可选的设计方案，然后把它秀给一组客户看，然后问他们更喜欢哪个？完全错误。如果用户没有实际准备使用该设计，他们会根据一些表面的特征来给出意见。这些输入经常和基于“实际操作”获得反馈形成强烈反差。

For example: A spinning logo might look pretty cool if you don't need to accomplish anything on the page. Another example is the drop-down menu. Users always love the idea: finally a standard user interface widget that they understand and that stays the same on every page. However, while they offer users a sense of power over the design, drop-down menus often have low usability and either confuse users or lead them to unintended parts of the site.

比如：一个旋转的LOGO会看起来很酷－－如果你不准备在页面上放置其他内容。另一个例子是下拉菜单。用户经常会很喜欢这样的意见：最后做一个他们可以理解的标准的用户界面，然后放置在每个页面的相同的地方。

然后，最后按照这个设计给用户交付这样一个界面时，下拉菜单往往在易用性上是很糟糕的，其他一些疑惑的用户往往顺着菜单去了他们本来不想去的地方。

To discover which designs work best, watch users as they attempt to perform tasks with the user interface. This method is so simple that many people overlook it, assuming that there must be something more to usability testing.

Of course, there are many ways to watch and many tricks to running an optimal user test or field study. But ultimately, the way to get user data boils down to the basic rules of usability:

要想发现什么设计是最好的，应该观察用户在界面上，是如何执行他们的操作的，这个方法是如此的简单，以至于很多人都忽视它， 而假设了一些用于验证可用性其他东西。当然，有许多可以在用户验证和现场调查中使用的观察方法或者技巧，但是最终，获取用户信息一定还是要归结到易用性的基本原则：Watch what people actually do.

观察用户实际是中怎么做的Do not believe what people say they do.

不要相信用户“说”的他们怎么做的。Definitely don't believe what people predict they may do in the future.

尤其不要相信用户预期的，他们未来“可能”会怎么做

Say, for example, that 50% of survey respondents claim they would buy more from e-commerce sites that offer 3D product views. Does this mean you should rush to implement 3D on your site? No. It means that 3D sounds cool. 

The world is littered with failed businesses that banked on people's attitude toward hypothetical products and services. In speculative surveys, people are simply guessing how they might act or which features they'll like; it doesn't meant they'll actually use or like them in real life.

再举个例子：50％的受访者都声称，如果提供3D的产品视图，他们在电子商务网站进行更多的购买。这意味着你应该马上开始在你的网站上实现3D视图吗？不，这仅仅意味着3D看上去比较酷。这个世界上充斥着由于投入在用户假定的产品和服务上而失败的商业例子。在这些充斥想像的调查中，人们都简单的猜想他们会做什么或者什么样的特性是他们喜欢的，但这并不意味着在实际生活中，他们真的会这么做或者喜欢。

When and How to Listen

何时以及如何聆听

When should you collect preference data from users? Only after they have used a design and have a real feeling for how well it supports them. Jonathan Levy and I analyzed data from 113 pairwise comparisons of user interfaces designed to support the same task and found a 0.44 correlation between users' measured performance and their stated preference. The more a design supports users in easily and efficiently doing what they want to do, the more they like the design. Very understandable.

你什么时候该收集用户的偏好数据？只有在他们已经有了实际应用，并且有了这个东西如何支持他们的真实想法以后。 Jonathan Levy 和我分析了从针对同一个任务的113对用户界面设计的比较数据后，发现在他们陈述的偏好和实际测量的偏好中，只有44％相吻合。设计越是支持用户容易的或者高效的做他们想做的事情，他们就越喜欢这个设计。非常容易理解。

However, when collecting preference data, you must take human nature into account. When talking about past behavior, users self-reported data is typically three steps removed from the truth:

不过，在收集这些偏好数据的时候，你一定要在数据中注意人性。 当在讲述过去的行为时，用户自己陈述的数据的时候，往往有三个环节，容易流失事实。In answering questions (particularly in a focus group), people bend the truth to be closer to what they think you want to hear or what's socially acceptable.

在回答问题时（尤其在典型群体中），人们往往会隐藏真相，而提供他们认为你想听到的信息，或者是社会普遍接受的信息。In telling you what they do, people are really telling you what they remember doing. Human memory is very fallible, especially regarding the small details that are crucial for interface design. Users cannot remember some details at all, such as interface elements that they didn't see.

在告诉你他们怎么做的时候，人们会告诉你他们记得做过的事情。人类的记忆是非常容易出错的，有其是在一些很细小的细节，但是对界面设计影响很大的地方。用户不会记住所有的细节，比如他们曾经看到的界面元素。

In reporting what they do remember, people rationalize their behavior. Countless times I have heard statements like "I would have seen the button if it had been bigger." Maybe. All we know is that the user didn't see the button.

在表述他们的回忆时，人们会把他们的行为合理化，无数次我听到这样的陈述“如果按钮再大一些，我可能就看到了”。也许，我们所得到的所有的信息就是用户没有看到这个按钮。

Finally, you must consider how and when to solicit feedback. Although it might be tempting to simply post a survey online, you're unlikely to get reliable input (if you get any at all). Users who see the survey and fill it out before they've used the site will offer irrelevant answers. Users who see the survey after they've used the site will most likely leave without answering the questions.

One question that does work well in a website survey is "Why are you visiting our site today?" This question goes to users' motivation and they can answer it as soon as they arrive.

最后，你必须考虑如何以及何时来收集反馈意见。尽管张贴一个在线调查会非常简单和容易，但你根本不要指望获得有效的反馈（如果你确实收集到了一些）。人们在真正使用一个网站之前，如果看到并填写反馈，往往都会随便填写一些无关的回答。用户如果在使用完一个网站后，如果看到调查问卷，一般会不予理睬。网站上这样的问题可能会有效果：“今天为什么来访问我们的网站？”这个问题主要关注用户的动机，他们可能会在刚来的时候就回答。

Your best bet in soliciting reliable feedback is to have a captive audience: Conduct formal testing and ask users to fill out a survey at the end. With techniques like paper prototyping, you can test designs and question users without implementing a thing. Following these basic usability rules and methods will help you ensure that your design is truly as cool as it looks.

你收集有效反馈的最有效的措施是让用户能真正投入：可以进行一个正规的测试，然后让用户最后填写反馈。 或者利用原型化的方法，你可以在具体实现之前，对设计进行测试并了解用户的问题。按照这些基本的易用性虹鳟则和方法，可以帮助你确定你的设计是不是他们看起来一样真的酷。Learn More
