Throwing Good Money After Bad

All booms eventually go bust.

所有的暴涨，最后都会终结We all remember the stock market crash of 2000, and most of us remember the real estate crash after the implementation of the 1986 Tax Reform Act. Today, many people are anticipating another real estate crash.

我们都记得2000年的时候股票市场崩盘，我们中的大多数人也都记得在1986年新税制改革以后，房地产市场的崩盘。今天，我们中的不少人也预见到了另一场房地产市场的崩溃。Unfortunately, despite our understanding of booms and inevitable busts, it's always near the top of a boom that "dumb money" buys in. Currently, this has set the scene for a potential market bust of which few people are aware. I'll describe it today's column, and advise how best to prepare in my next column.

不幸的是，不管我们如何意识到暴涨最后一定会下跌，它仍然由于大量“非理性投资者”买入接近暴涨的顶点。现在，就象少数人预见到的，这是在为一个被拉的很高的市场的破灭在做最后准备。　在今天的专栏里，我将解释这个现象。下一个专栏我将给出最好的应对建议。

Express-Lane Inspiration

高速公路-羊肠小道的启示

About a year ago, I wrote a Yahoo! Finance column warning readers that the real estate boom was over. How did I forecast the end of the boom? I got my hot tip from the cashier at my local Safeway supermarket.

一年前，我在YAHOO财经专栏上警告读者，房地产的暴涨将要结束了，我是怎么样预见到这个暴涨的终结的？我当地的超级市场的收银员那里得到了重要的启示。While she was tallying the cost of my apples, broccoli, and steaks, she handed me her new real estate agent's card and invited me to call her for my next real estate investment. Moments later, I was home writing that column. As my rich dad used to say, "When dumb money chases smart money, the party's over." Needless to say, many real estate agents and investors wrote me nasty notes.

当她在给我买的苹果，椰菜，牛排算账的时候，她给我一份新的房产代理的名片，然后让我在进行下一个房产投资的时候叫上她。过了一会儿，我回到家里写了那个专栏，在我的“富爸爸”中曾经写过：“当非理性的投资者开始追逐精明的投资者时，这个盛宴就已经结束了”，不用说，很多房地产代理商和投资者用恶毒的留言回应我。

I'm not a hundred-percent certain where things are going today. Most economists are forecasting a strong economy, but economists worry me more than newly minted real estate agents. Most seem to be happy that inflation is in check; when I hear that inflation is in check, I begin to think about deflation, and as most of us know, deflation is much, much, worse than inflation.

我今天不敢百分之百打保票事情会如何发展，大多数经济学家正在预测一个更繁荣的经济，但比起担心最新新冒出来的那些房地产经纪人，他们更担心我。大多数人似乎乐于看到通货膨胀在减轻，当我听到通货膨胀在减轻的时候，我开始考虑通货紧缩，就象我们中很多人知道的那样，通货紧缩实际上要比通货膨胀要糟糕好多，好多，好多倍。

An Inconvenient Truth

一个并不合适的事实

In the simplest terms, inflation occurs when there' too much money in the system. On the flip side, deflation occurs when there are too few dollars in circulation. When that happens, prices start to fall. For example, in inflationary times, prices of houses go up. In deflationary times, prices of houses come down. If prices of houses begin to drop too fast right now, it could be 1986 all over again.

用最简单的话来说，当系统中有太多的钱的时候，通货膨胀就出现了。另一方面，当参与流通的钱变得太少的时候，通货紧缩就出现了。当这些发生的时候，物价开始下降。打个比方，在一个有通货膨胀倾向的时候，房产的价格上升，在一个有通货紧缩倾向的时候，房产价格下降，如果房产价格突然下降的非常快，1986年的情况就会重复。

I wrote a column in 2005 about how I love debt and my credit cards. The trouble is that most people do. Today, you can qualify for a loan to buy a house simply if you're alive and breathing.

我在2005年写过一个专栏，讲我是多么的爱我的债务和我的信用卡。但是现在问题在于每个人都这么干。今天，只要你还活着或者还能呼吸，你就有资格非常容易的申请到买房的贷款。

The strong economy we've been experiencing for years has thus been built on dumb money -- in addition to smart money -- borrowing more and more. Even the U.S. government has had a field day borrowing money to do such things as fight a war and attempt to rebuild Iraq and Afghanistan rather than rebuild our country. And the inconvenient truth about debt is that it has to be paid back.

由非理性的资金构筑的繁荣经济我们已经体验了很多年了，这些非理性的投资者———那些精明的投资者除外———借贷越来越多，连美国政府都忙着借钱去干诸如打仗，重建伊拉克和阿富汗，而不是建设我们自己的国家。一个并不合适的事实就是：这些钱都是需要还的。

A Certain Ratio

一个确定的比例

For the next two years, I'm cautioning people to watch their ratios between good debt and bad debt, and keep liquid reserves such as cash, gold, or silver.

在接下来的两年里，我不停的警告人们需要注意他们的优良债务和不良债务的比例，需要保留一些“流动”的东西，比如现金，黄金或者白银。Good debt is debt that makes you rich. An example of good debt is the debt on the apartment houses I own. That debt is good only as long as there are tenants to pay my mortgages. If tenants stop paying their rent, my good debt turns into bad debt.

优良的债务可以使你变得富裕。比如在我自己的公寓房上的债务就是优良债务，这个债务只在能出租并用租金偿还抵押贷款的时候才是优良的，如果承租人停止付租金，优良债务就会变成不良债务。Most people don't have good debt -- all they have is bad debt. Bad debt is debt that makes you poorer. I count the mortgage on my home as bad debt, because I'm the one paying on it. Other forms of bad debt are car payments, credit card balances, or other consumer loans.

大多数人都没有优良债务———他们有的都是不良债务，不良债务是使我们变得贫穷的债务，我把我自己住的房子算作不良债务，因为只有我一个人在为它付钱。另一种形式的不良债务就是买车，信用卡结账，和其他消费类债务。

On our home, my wife, Kim, and I keep a 25 percent debt-to-equity ratio. In other words, our debt is 25 percent of the home's value. Unfortunately, many people have an 80 percent or higher debt-to-equity ratio. That means the debt on their home is 80 percent and their equity is only 20 percent.

在我们自己的房子上，我的妻子，金和我保持了25%的净资产债务。换句话说，我们房子的25%的价值是债务。不幸的是，很多人都背负了80%甚至更高的高额净资产债务，这意味着他们房子的的80%都是债务，而他们自己的净资产只有20%。

On our investment properties, we carry a higher debt-to-equity ratio. To protect ourselves, we have cash reserves to cover the expenses of the properties. For example, in case all the tenants leave and no one is left to pay the mortgage and expenses, we have separate funds for each property, with enough liquidity -- i.e. cash, stocks, and bonds -- to carry the building for a year. Unfortunately, the dumb-money crowd has no reserve funds for their properties.

在我们的投资项目中，我们则保持了一个更高的债务比例。为了保护我们自己，我们拥有可以支付该项目全部费用的现金储量。比如，万一所有的房客都离开了，没有人租我的房子，替我付抵押贷款和其他开支怎么办，所以每个项目我们都有单独的资金储备,是一些足够的流动的东西———比如现金，股票，国债———来继续维持这些房子一些年。不幸的是，大量的非理性投资者，并没有为他们的项目保留资金。

Where Deflation Does Its Damage

通货紧缩在哪里进行它的破坏In a deflationary market, the value of your home can drop. If the value drops, the bank may call in your loan. Even if you've never missed a payment, and even if you're ahead on the payment schedule, the bank can call in your loan if they feel the value of the property is lower than the loan amount.

在一个通货紧缩的市场里，你的房子的价值在下跌。如果房产价格下跌，银行可能来收回你的贷款。即使你还是正常按期付款，甚至你总是比还款计划还提前的还款。银行会收回你的贷款当他们觉得房产的的价格已经低于贷款总量的时候。

For example, say you buy a house for $100,000 and put 20 percent down and borrow $80,000. If the market deflates and the value of your home drops to $70,000 (because everyone else is selling their homes to get out of debt), the lender may ask you to pay the $80,000 you owe immediately.

举个例子，假设你用10万美元买房，自己付了20%并且借了8万，如果市场通缩，你的房产价格低到7万（由于其他的每个人都想尽快卖掉房子还债），借方会让你把欠的 8万马上还清。If such deflation happens, cash will become king. There will be half-price sales on BMWs, expensive restaurants will close, and people will be out of work. And anybody who caters to people with dumb money will be in trouble. As I said before, deflation is much worse than inflation.

如果这样的通货紧缩发生，现金就会为王，宝马轿车可能会半价出售，昂贵的餐馆会关门，人们都会出来工作，那些为这些不良投资者服务的人就要倒霉了。就象我以前说的，通货紧缩会比通货膨胀更加糟糕。

Smart Money, Bad Times

精明的投资者，不景气的光景

The good news is that during deflationary times, smart money reenters the market, so crashes are great for smart people with smart money. Instead of listening to the optimistic economists, then, you should eliminate bad debt and improve your debt-to-equity ratios on good debt.

一个好消息就是，在通货紧缩的时候，精明的投资者会重新进入市场，所以现金对精明的人和精明投资者是非常重要的。不要去听那些乐观的经济学家，接着，你需要消除你的不良债务，改善你在优良债务上的负债比例。Most important, study; if you want to be smart, you need to learn. I'll discuss what you should study in the second part of this column. For now, be aware that if deflation comes and there's a recession, it won't have much effect on the poor. Instead, it'll punish middle-class people who think they're rich because their houses and stocks have gone up in value.

最重要的是：学习。如果你想变得精明，你需要去学习。我在这个专栏的第二部分会讨论你该学习什么。 从现在开始，你需要意识到通货紧缩即将到来，然后紧接着是衰退，这对穷人没有什么影响，它将惩罚那些由于房产和股票升值而自以为有钱了的中产阶级。

I'll explain more in a couple of weeks.在接下来的两周，我会进一步解释这些。
