In 1966, I was traveling the Pacific aboard a freighter. I was 19 years old at the time and attending the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, N.Y.

1966年，我乘坐货船在太平洋旅行，那时我19岁，并且进入了美国商业海运学院。

As part of my academy education, I spent a year as a student officer on freighters, passenger liners, oil tankers, and even tugboats. It was a great way to see and study the world.

在学院学习期间，我花了一年在货船，客船，油船甚至是拖船上当实习船员。这是了解和研究世界的一个很好的方式。

An Instructive Exchange

一次有启示意义的交易One of the earliest lessons I learned at sea was about currency exchange rates. Even though currency valuation was not a subject taught at the Merchant Marine academy, my ship constantly traveled from one country to the next, so my education in what is today called FX -- or foreign exchange -- began.

在海上我最早学习到的是有关货币汇率的，尽管货币比价并不是学院教我的课程。我的船经常从一个国家航行到另外一个国家，所以我的教育--现在叫对外贸易--开始了。

Back then, the formal exchange rate in the banks was 360 Japanese yen to one U.S. dollar. On the black market in Hong Kong, I could get 366 yen to the dollar.

在那个时候，银行的正式汇率是360日元兑换1美元，在香港的黑市，我能用1美元换366日元。

This made me aware of the games banks and countries play with their currencies: In 1966, the six-yen difference told me that Japan was buying more from Hong Kong, which is why yen was cheaper in the then-British colony.

这使我开始意识到这个银行和国家之间用他们的货币玩的游戏：在1966年，6日元的差距告诉我日本正在从香港购买更多的东西，这就是为什么在香港（那时还是英国殖民地）日元更便宜。

A six-yen difference might not seem like much, but for a student earning just $105 a month every little bit counts. So I would wait for my ship to stop in Hong Kong and then trade U.S. dollars for yen. Then I would travel back to Japan and go shopping with the yen. Although the money I saved wasn't substantial, the lessons it offered in currency exchange were priceless.

6日元的差距看起来并不能说明什么，但是对一个每月挣105美元的学生而言，还是有很多意义的。所以我希望我的船能停在香港，然后把我的美元换成日元，然后我回到日本，用这些日元来消费。尽管我省下来的钱并不多，但从中学到的汇率知识却是非常宝贵的。

The End of the Golden Age

金本位时代的终结

It was pretty easy to understand foreign exchange back in the mid-‘60s, since much of the world was following the Bretton Woods Agreement. Enacted in 1944, this agreement made the U.S. dollar the global medium of exchange.

在60年代中期的外汇交换还是很容易理解的。那时世界大部分国家都遵循布雷顿森林协议。这个协议从1944年签署后，就使美元成为全球性的交易媒介。

Because the U.S. dollar was pegged to gold, figuring exchange rates was a cinch. If we purchased too much from Japan, then the Japanese could ask us for gold. If we had less gold, we had less money.

因为美元是和黄金挂钩，外汇汇率是比较牢固的。 如果我们从日本订购了许多东西，日本会向我们索要黄金。如果我们的黄金少了，我们的钱就少了。

In 1971, President Richard Nixon changed everything by removing the U.S. dollar from the gold standard. Suddenly, the dollar was still the world's currency, but now it was backed by nothing. The United States was free to print as much money as it wanted, and the world went along.

在1971年，尼克松总统通过把美元和黄金脱钩改变了这一切。突然之间，尽管美元还是世界的货币，但是没有任何东西支撑，美国政府可以随心所欲的印制货币，整个世界也都是一样操作了。

Because of this change, understanding foreign exchange became a bit more complex. Today, to understand the world of currency, you need to think a little differently -- essentially because things don't make sense.

由于这种变化，理解外汇交易变得有一点复杂，今天，要理解货币的世界，你需要你需要有一些不同的思考，本质上，这些东西不代表任何含义。

For example, today, the United States is perceived to be the richest country in the world. In reality, though, we're the biggest debtor nation in the world. And who are we indebted to? What many consider to be a Third World country: China.

举个例子，今天，美国被认为是世界上最富裕的国家。实际上，我们是世界上最大的债务国。我们对谁负债？ 很多人都会想到一个第三世界国家：中国。

For Richer and Poorer

更穷和更富The irony is that many Americans think we're rich and China is poor. Exactly the opposite is true. This is because the removal of gold's backing from paper money has created a virtual explosion in credit and liquidity. The sheer amount of liquidity around the globe is incalculable.

有讽刺意味的是，很多美国人认为我们富裕和中国贫穷。实际上相反的一面才是对的。这是因为黄金和纸币的脱钩，用信贷和流动性制造了一个虚拟的暴涨。全球的流动资金的总数已经不可计数。

This excess funny money causes people to feel rich and almost everything to be more expensive. Today, stocks, real estate, automobiles, and gasoline become more expensive as the dollar becomes cheaper.

这些滥发的过剩货币导致人们感觉自己变得富裕，而且大部分东西都变得昂贵。今天，股票，房产，汽车都由于美元的贬值而变得更加昂贵。

While some people do become richer in this system, funny money actually punishes working people who save money. It devalues the value of your work and your savings, even though you may feel wealthier.

一旦一些人们在这个系统中变得富裕。滥发的钱实际上就在惩罚那些存钱的工薪一族。它使你的工作以及你的储蓄贬值，即使这样，你还是觉得更有钱了。

In overly simplistic terms, China and many countries in the world today lend us billions of dollars to buy their goods. They send us products like computers, televisions, cars, candies, and wines, and we send them funny money in return.

用简单化的描述就是：中国和世界上的其他国家借给我们数以亿记的美元来买他们自己的商品。他们给我们送来很多产品比如计算机，电话，汽车，糖果和酒，然后我们给他们这些滥发的货币印刷品。

Since they can't spend those dollars at home, they simply lend them back to us so we'll buy more of their products. That would be like me going to my local grocery store and asking them for a loan so I could buy their tomatoes. A logical person would say, "That makes no sense." Yet it's exactly what happened after 1971, and to many highly educated people -- bankers and politicians, for instance -- it somehow does make sense.

然后，他们不会在他们自己的国家来花这些货币，他们会简单的把这些钱再借给我们，这样，我们就可以来买他们更多的商品。这就好像我们走进当地的杂货店，让他们借钱给我们，然后我们用这些钱来买西红柿。 任何一个有逻辑头脑的人都会说：“这简直搞笑”。但这正是1971年以后发生的事情，而且这样的事情对很多受过高等教育的人———比如银行家，政治家———不知为什么显得非常有意义。

An Uneven Trade

不平等的贸易

You can find current smaller examples of such financial insanity. For example, many people refinance their homes to pay off their credit cards. This makes no sense; you and I know that someday that debt will have to be paid.

你可以为这种经济上的错乱找一个恰当的小例子：比如许多人抵押他们的房子来偿还他们的信用卡，这没有任何问题，你和我都知道这些债务总有一天是必须要还的。

Yet getting deeper into debt does make sense as long as you can repay your lender with cheaper dollars, and as long as your lender is willing to take those cheaper, less-valuable dollars. To use my earlier analogy, it would be like buying an orange for $1 on credit and then paying him back for it a year later with 80 cents. As long as the grocer is happy with this arrangement, things are fine.

当然，债台高筑也许使你试图用更便宜的美元来还债，如果你的债主原意接受这些更便宜的美元。还是用刚才的比方，就象用1美元的信贷买了一个西红柿，然后你过了一年还他80美分。只要杂货店乐意接受，一切都很好。

In real-world terms, one of the reasons the U.S. dollar only buys approximately 110 yen instead of 360 yen today is because the Japanese allowed us to continually devalue the dollar -- that is, to pay our debts with cheaper dollars.

在现实世界中，今天一美元只能兑换大概110日元而不是360日元的一个原因就是：日本政府允许我们让美元不断的贬值。－－就是说，用更便宜的美元支付账单。

Over the years, the yen got stronger and the dollar got weaker simply because we, as a nation, printed more and more money, all the while consuming more and producing less. Japan would lend us money and we would buy their products. Japan's economy boomed, and so did ours.

这些年里，日元不断的上涨，美元不断下跌仅仅是因为我们，作为一个国家，印刷了越来越多的货币，同时消费增多，生产减少。日本会借给我们钱，我们会买他们的商品，日本经济繁荣，我们也是一样。

Game Over?

游戏结束了？

The problem today is that China isn't willing to play the game the way the Japanese did. If we drop the purchasing power of the dollar, the Chinese, by pegging their currency to the dollar, also drop the value of their currency. The United States then pays back its debt with a cheaper dollar.

今天的问题是中国并不愿意象日本那样玩这个游戏。如果我们降低美元的购买力，中国会紧跟美元，同样让他们的货币贬值。然后美国再用贬值的货币来偿还债务。

The irony is that we accuse China of playing games with their money. It's more honest to say that China just isn't willing to play the game we want to play.

有讽刺意味的是，我们指控中国在他们自己的货币上玩游戏。更诚实的说，是中国不原意按照我们的游戏规则玩。

But an even bigger problem is looming: It seems like the rest of the world is less willing to play our money game. That's why the European Union introduced the Euro. If China creates an Asian equivalent of the Euro (which, admittedly, is a long shot) then the U.S. dollar could be in real trouble.

但是一个更严重的问题正在浮现：看起来世界上其他国家也越来越不原意玩我们的货币游戏。这就是为什么欧盟创立了欧元的原因。如果中国也建立和欧元对应的亚洲等价货币（不可否认，是一个高风险赌博），美元就真的碰到麻烦了。

If the oil-producing nations stop accepting the dollar and switch to gold or the Euro, things will definitely get sticky. The world might be tipped into a global recession and possibly even a depression.

如果产油国拒绝接受美元并转向黄金和欧元，事情就会变得极为糟糕，世界会进入全球性的衰退甚至可能是萧条。

For now, though, this funny money game continues. How long will it last? I don't know. I do know that throughout history, all paper money has eventually come back to its true value, which is zero. That's when the game truly ends, and a whole new cycle of pass the buck begins.

现在，尽管这些滥发金钱的游戏还在继续，它还能持续多长时间？我不知道，我知道从整个历史上看，所有的纸币最终都会回到它的真实价值，就是0。这就是这个游戏真正结束的时候，然后新的一轮转嫁开始。
