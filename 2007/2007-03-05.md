Rich Today, Poor Tomorrow

今天的富裕，明天的贫穷by Robert Kiyosaki　罗伯特.清崎

As promised in my last article, this week I'll explain why deflation will severely punish the upper middle class. These are the people who think they're rich because their houses and stocks have gone up in value -- that is, because of inflation.

按照上篇文章中我的承诺，本周，我将解释一下为什么通货紧缩会给中产阶级带来严重的后果，人们都认为他们变得越来越富裕是因为他们的房产和股票在升值———或者说，是因为通货膨胀。

What Goes Up...

People concerned about inflation today tend to buy big houses and nice cars. They believe that the purchasing power of the dollar is going down. But what happens if cash becomes king?

到底什么在上涨？

人们由于通货膨胀的预期而去买大房子和好车子，因为他们相信美元的购买力在下降，但是如果真的出现现金为王，会发生什么？

This cash squeeze is already affecting many people who thought they were rich. My wife, Kim, has a friend who's a successful architect. Her husband was a manager of a good sized advertising agency. They have three children, the oldest in high school, and earn about $350,000 a year in combined income.

现金周转困难的问题已经开始影响那些认为自己变富裕的人。　我的妻子金的一个朋友是一个成功的设计师，她的丈夫是一个很大的广告中介的经理。　三个小孩，一年３５万美元收入。

Because they were flush with cash, this couple purchased two high-end vacation homes, one in the mountains and one at the beach. They live most of the year in a McMansion in Phoenix.

由于现金很充裕，他们买了两套高端度假屋，一个在山上，一个在海边，他们大部分时间在凤凰城的公寓里面住。

Things were going along fine until the husband lost his biggest client. Then he lost his job, and in less than three months their savings was depleted. They then tried to sell their vacation homes, but the values had dropped below the mortgage amount. Today, they continue to pay the mortgages on their houses and hope the price of real estate will go back up. They sold one of their BMWs at a loss.

在她丈夫失去一个最大客户之前，一切都不错。 不过他丈夫失去工作三个月以后，他们的储蓄就告罄了。 于是他们试图卖掉自己的度假屋，但是卖价已经比抵押价还低了。现在，他们继续的为房子的抵押付款，并且希望房产的价格可以回升，另外他们亏本卖了他们的宝马轿车。In 2005, they were net-worth millionaires. In 2007, they're facing bankruptcy.

在2005年，他们的净资产有百万，但是在2007年，他们面临破产。

Follow the Arrows

跟随箭头

People like this couple aren't concerned enough about is the credit bubble bursting, which could lead to deflation. Today, nationwide savings are low and debt per household is up. Most of us know the following equation from Economics 101:

象这对夫妇一样的人们没有给予足够考虑的是信贷泡沫的破灭，这导致了通货紧缩。今天，全国性的储蓄已经非常低，而每个人家的负债则在不断增长，我们中的大多数都在经济学101中看过这个等式：cash + credit = the economy

现金+信贷 = 经济

Ever since 2000, there's been an oversupply of credit. When the Y2K threat loomed, the Federal Reserve flooded the market with credit. After the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and the stock market downturn in 2002, the market was again flooded with easy credit. Excessive credit and lower interest rates kept the economy afloat.

2000年以来，信贷的供应显然是过度了，当千年虫问题接近的时候，联邦储备系统在市场上滥发信贷，在恐怖分子制造了911，股票市场在2002年下跌以后，这个市场又一次的信贷泛滥。过度的信贷和越来越低的利率维持的经济的运行。

It was a smart move at the time. In the first five years of his presidency, President Bush borrowed nearly a trillion dollars, more money than all of our previous 43 presidents combined, and the resulting credit bubble helped keep the stock market from collapsing entirely and led to a boom in real estate.

在那时，这是一个精明的行动，在任期的最初5个年头，布什总统大概借了1万亿美元，比他前任43个总统借债的总和还多，结果是信用泡沫维持了股票市场免于崩溃，而且使房地产市场极度繁荣。The problem is that this debt must be repaid. So the trillion-dollar question is, can the government, businesses, and consumers keep the credit bubble inflated? Here's that equation:

问题是：这些债务是一定要还的。所以这1万亿美元的问题是：政府，企业和消费者是否还能保持这个信用泡沫继续膨胀？ 这里是那个等式:(现金+信贷上涨 = 经济上涨（通货膨胀）)↑

cash +↑

credit↑

= the economy (inflationary)If credit is cut off or the debt can't be repaid, the equation changes to this:

如果信贷被掐断了，或者贷款无法偿还，等式就变成这个：（通货紧缩）cash +

↓credit

↓= the economy (deflationary)

↓Fresh-Squeezed Stocks

If the credit bubble bursts, it could trigger a short squeeze.

如果信贷泡沫破灭，它将引发逼空（空头逼仓）

"Short squeeze," a trader term, is when a stock's price is high and many traders short the stock. Shorting a stock means borrowing shares from an investment house, selling them, and hoping the price of the stock drops. When the price drops, a trader buys the stock back and returns it to the investment house he borrowed it from.

“逼空”是投资术语，指当一个股票价格攀高，很多投资者抛出股票。这里的抛出股票是说他们从投资公司借出这些股票（自己并没有），卖掉它们。然后等待股票价格下跌。当股票价格下跌时，投资者买回这个股票并且把它还给投资公司。For example, say XYZ stock is selling for $100 a share. A trader borrows 10 shares from the investment house and sells them for $1,000. The stock drops to $60. Now the trader buys back 10 shares from the market for $600 and returns the 10 shares to the investment house. He now has a gross profit of $400 before paying interest and fees to the investment house.

举例来说：XYZ股票每股卖100美元，一个投资者从投资公司借出10股，然后卖了1000美元。 这个股票跌到了60美元，现在投资者用600美元从市场上买回10股，然后把这10股还给投资公司。他现在在付利息和支付投资公司酬金前就有了400美元的毛利润。

A short squeeze occurs when the market goes the other way. In this example, instead of XYZ stock dropping to $60 a share, it rises from $100 to $150. The investment house issues a margin call, which means the trader needs to return the 10 shares he borrowed.

逼空发生在市场走向发生变化时。还是这个例子，假设股票不是降到了60美元，而是从100美元上涨到了150美元，投资公司会要求增收保证金，这意味着投资者需要归还原来的10股。

Suddenly, all the other traders who shorted the stock need to buy shares of XYZ in order to return them. As more short traders begin buying XYZ, the price of the stock goes up and up -- from $150 to $160 to $170, for instance. This is a short squeeze in stocks. The traders who thought the price of the stock would go down are squeezed into becoming the ones who drive the price up.

突然间，所有其他的其他抛掉这个股票的投资者都需要买XYZ，来归还它们，当更多的投资者购买XYZ的时候，这个股票的价格会越来越高，从150到160到170，在这个例子上，这就是一个股票空头逼仓。认为股价会下降的投资者被挤压成推动价格上涨的人。

Putting the Squeeze on the Economy

把这个挤压放在经济上A short squeeze could happen with the U.S. dollar if lenders suddenly forced debtors to pay in cash.

一个“逼空”会发生在美元上，如果借款方突然要被迫用现金偿还贷款。

The couple I mentioned above is technically caught in a short squeeze, since they're short of cash and long on debt. They had to sell their luxury car at a huge loss because they were desperate. As time goes on and their savings dwindles, they may become desperate enough to sell their vacation homes at huge losses.

我上边提到的夫妇就遭遇了一次技术上的逼空，由于它们现金短缺并且长期负债，他们必须以很大的损失来出售豪华轿车，因为他们没有别的办法。如果这样继续下去，他们的储蓄继续减少，他们也许会需要同样低价卖掉他们度假屋。If the credit markets bust, there could be millions of couples just like this who seemed rich but are suddenly poor. This could send the lending rate of the dollar higher, making the value of the dollar higher as well -- essentially causing a deflation.

如果信贷市场破灭，会有数百万那样看起来很富裕的夫妇突然间变穷。 而这会使美元的借款利率更高，相当于使美元升值———本质上，导致了通货紧缩。I don't want the U.S. economy to go into a short squeeze, and I hope the credit bubble doesn't burst. Deflation isn't good, and inflation is easier to cure than deflation.

我不希望美国经济进入逼空，我希望信贷泡沫不要破灭，通货紧缩不好，通货膨胀比通货紧缩更容易治愈。

Invest in Money Smarts

精明的投资

My concern about deflation is best represented by the following equation:

我关于通货紧缩的担心用如下等式表述：cash +

↓credit

↓= the economy (recession)

↓If the credit bubble bursts, not only will credit disappear, but people will stop spending and start hoarding cash, and savings will increase. Money is fuel for the economy, so when credit is gone and money is in hiding, the economy slows and a recession -- or worse, a depression -- can occur. In this case, prices go down, not up, and cash becomes king.

如果信贷泡沫破灭了，不仅是信贷会消失，人们也会停止开销而开始存款，储蓄开始增长，货币是经济的燃料，没有了信贷，现金都隐藏起来，经济就会变慢和衰退———或者更糟糕的说，萧条———就会出现。 由于这个原因，物价下跌而不是上涨，现金为王。

I certainly don't want this to happen. Nonetheless, given the lack of a clear direction in markets today, a good investment for 2007 may be to pay off some high-interest debt, put a little extra cash aside, and wait for bargains. If there's a short squeeze on cash, I believe it will be short lived. Once the Fed pumps more money into the system, the dollar will continue its fall.

我当然不希望这些发生。虽然如此，现在的市场上，我也给不出很清晰的指导。 在2007年的一个好投资就是还清那些高利率的贷款，身边留一些现金，等待物价下跌。如果现金上发生了紧缩，我相信持续时间不长，一旦联邦储备委员会注入更多的资金，美元还可能持续下跌。

In conclusion, your best investment today may be in time, not money. That is, invest your time in studying, reading books, and going to seminars. I recommend you study the asset class that's high-priced today, and could be low-priced tomorrow. For example, if you want to acquire real estate, study real estate while prices are high.

结论是，你现在最好的投资是在时间，而不是金钱。 也就是说，把你的时间投入在学习，读书，和参加研讨培训班上。我建议你关注和研究那些现在价格很昂贵的资产，他们明天也许价格会下跌，比如你想获得房地产，就要在房地产价格很高的时候注意关注和研究它。And if and when the market crashes, be ready to buy.

一旦市场崩溃，就准备买入。
