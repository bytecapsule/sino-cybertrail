美国的新贵族

As the importance of intellectual capital grows, privilege has become increasingly heritable

随着智力资本重要性的提高，特权已经变得日渐可以继承了。

WHEN the candidates for the Republican presidential nomination line up on stage for their first debate in August, there may be three contenders whose fathers also ran for president. Whoever wins may face the wife of a former president next year. It is odd that a country founded on the principle of hostility to inherited status should be so tolerant of dynasties. Because America never had kings or lords, it sometimes seems less inclined to worry about signs that its elite is calcifying.

当共和党总统提名候选人在今年8月登台进行首次辩论时，其中可能有三名父亲也参与过总统竞选的竞争者。不管谁赢，都可能在来年面临一位前总统的妻子。令人不解的是，一个建立在对现状来自继承这种事充满敌视态度之上的国家竟然对家族政治如此地容忍。由于美国从来没有国王或贵族。因此，这个国家有时似乎还不太为精英阶层正在固化的这种迹象而担忧。

Thomas Jefferson drew a distinction between a natural aristocracy of the virtuous and talented, which was a blessing to a nation, and an artificial aristocracy founded on wealth and birth, which would slowly strangle it. Jefferson himself was a hybrid of these two types—a brilliant lawyer who inherited 11,000 acres and 135 slaves from his father-in-law—but the distinction proved durable.

When the robber barons accumulated fortunes that made European princes envious, the combination of their own philanthropy, their children's extravagance and federal trust-busting meant that Americans never discovered what it would be like to live in a country where the elite could reliably reproduce themselves.

托马斯·杰弗逊曾把贵族分为两种。一种是天生的贵族，他们为人正直，富有才华，是上天赐给国家福分；另一种人为制造出来的贵族，他们的基础是财富和出身，这种贵族会慢慢地扼杀一个国家。杰弗逊本人就是这两种贵族的混合体——一位从岳父那里继承了11000英亩土地和135名奴隶的杰出律师。但是，这种区分已经被证明具有相当的生命力。就在强盗大亨们积累了令欧洲贵族眼红的巨额财富之时，他们自己的慈善行为和他们后代的挥霍无度以及联邦政府对于垄断的打击，这三种事实形成了一股合力，让美国人至今尚未发现生活在一个精英阶层能够复制自己的世界中会是什么样。

Now they are beginning to find out, because today's rich increasingly pass on to their children an asset that cannot be frittered away in a few nights at a casino. It is far more useful than wealth, and invulnerable to inheritance tax. It is brains.

如今，他们已经开始认识到这个问题了。其原因在于，越来越多的富人正在把一种资产传给他们的后代。这是一种不可能被几个夜晚的豪赌挥霍殆尽的资产，它远比财富有用，而且不受遗产税的影响。它就是智力。

Intellectual capital drives the knowledge economy, so those who have lots of it get a fat slice of the pie. And it is increasingly heritable. Far more than in previous generations, clever, successful men marry clever, successful women. Such “assortative mating” increases inequality by 25%, by one estimate, since two-degree households typically enjoy two large incomes.

Power couples conceive bright children and bring them up in stable homes—only 9% of college-educated mothers who give birth each year are unmarried, compared with 61% of high-school dropouts. They stimulate them relentlessly: children of professionals hear 32m more words by the age of four than those of parents on welfare.

They move to pricey neighbourhoods with good schools, spend a packet on flute lessons and pull strings to get junior into a top-notch college.

智力资本推动知识经济。因此，拥有大量智力资本的人得到了蛋糕中最肥美的那一块。不仅如此，智力资本正在变得具有继承性。在这一代人中，聪明成功的男人与聪明成功的女人结为夫妻的人数远远超过前几代人。据估算，由于夫妻双方都拥有学位的家庭一般都享有两份高收入，因此，这种“选择性婚配”加重了不平等，其程度为25％。权力夫妻生育的是有光明前途的后代，并且能够在稳定的家庭中将他们的后代养大成人——在年年都生育的妇女中，受过高等教育的母亲只有9％是未婚者。相比之下，61％的都是高中辍学生。他们无情地激励自己后代：专业人士的孩子在长到4岁时，已经比父母是依靠福利生活的孩子多听到了3200万个单词。他们把家搬到有好学校的昂贵社区，花大笔的钱去培养孩子的各种兴趣爱好，费劲心思让他们的后代进入名牌大学。

The universities that mould the American elite seek out talented recruits from all backgrounds, and clever poor children who make it to the Ivy League may have their fees waived entirely. But middle-class students have to rack up huge debts to attend college, especially if they want a post-graduate degree, which many desirable jobs now require.

The link between parental income and a child's academic success has grown stronger, as clever people become richer and splash out on their daughter's Mandarin tutor, and education matters more than it used to, because the demand for brainpower has soared.

A young college graduate earns 63% more than a high-school graduate if both work full-time—and the high-school graduate is much less likely to work at all. For those at the top of the pile, moving straight from the best universities into the best jobs, the potential rewards are greater than they have ever been.

塑造美国精英的大学虽然也从各个社会阶层中搜罗有才华的新生，而且向常春藤名校提交了申请的聪明的穷人孩子可能还会被免处全部的学费。但是，中产家庭的学生却不得不借一大笔债才能进入大学，尤其是在这些孩子想得到许多令人满意的工作当前都需要的硕士学位时。随着聪明的人越来越有钱，而且不惜为后代拥有一技之长而投入重金，父母的收入同孩子的学习成绩之间的联系变得愈发强烈。同时，随着对智力的需求大幅攀升，教育的重要性已经今非昔比。在双方都有全职工作的情况下，年轻的大学毕业生能够比高中毕业生多挣63％。但是，这只是在高中毕业生极不可能有全职工作的情况下进行的对比。对于人上人来说，他们能够在离开名牌大学后直接进入最好的工作，而且潜在的回报也比以前多。

None of this is peculiar to America, but the trend is most visible there. This is partly because the gap between rich and poor is bigger than anywhere else in the rich world—a problem Barack Obama alluded to repeatedly in his state-of-the-union address on January 20th.

It is also because its education system favours the well-off more than anywhere else in the rich world. Thanks to hyperlocal funding, America is one of only three advanced countries where the government spends more on schools in rich areas than in poor ones.

Its university fees have risen 17 times as fast as median incomes since 1980, partly to pay for pointless bureaucracy and flashy buildings. And many universities offer “legacy” preferences, favouring the children of alumni in admissions.

上述种种事实没有一件是美国所独有的，但是，这种趋势在美国表现的最为明显。这部分是因为美国的贫富差距在富裕国家中是最大的——这是贝拉克·奥巴马在1月20日的国情咨文中曾经反复提及的一个问题。这还因为美国的教育体系在富裕国家中是最倾向于富人的。拜教育经费主要由地方出资所赐，美国是仅有的政府对富裕地区的教育投入多于贫穷地区的3个发达国家之一。自1980年以来，美国大学学费一直在上涨，速度是收入中位数上涨速度的17倍，而且这些钱大都被用于毫无意义的学校官僚机构和各种富丽堂皇的建筑。与此同时，许多大学还能够为“遗少”提供特殊待遇，能够在招生中优先录取校友的后代。

Nurseries, not tumbrils

幼儿园，不是施肥车

The solution is not to discourage rich people from investing in their children, but to do a lot more to help clever kids who failed to pick posh parents. The moment to start is in early childhood, when the brain is most malleable and the right kind of stimulation has the largest effect.

There is no substitute for parents who talk and read to their babies, but good nurseries can help, especially for the most struggling families; and America scores poorly by international standards.

Improving early child care in the poorest American neighbourhoods yields returns of ten to one or more; few other government investments pay off so handsomely.

解决之道不是不鼓励富人为他们的后代投资，而是要尽力去帮助那些无法选择权贵父母的聪明孩子。起始点在婴幼儿时期。这是智力最具可塑性的阶段，正确的激励能够产生最大的效应。没有什么可以代替给孩子说话为孩子读书的父母，但是，良好的幼儿园能够有所帮助，尤其是对生活最困难的家庭。另外，以国际标准来衡量，美国的教育水平还得不到高分。改善美国最贫穷社区的儿童早教的回报为10％或者以上；很少有其他的政府投资能够受到这么好的回报。

Many schools are in the grip of one of the most anti-meritocratic forces in America: the teachers' unions, which resist any hint that good teaching should be rewarded or bad teachers fired. To fix this, and the scandal of inequitable funding, the system should become both more and less local. Per-pupil funding should be set at the state level and tilted to favour the poor. Dollars should follow pupils, through a big expansion of voucher schemes or charter schools.

In this way, good schools that attract more pupils will grow; bad ones will close or be taken over. Unions and their Democratic Party allies will howl, but experiments in cities such as battered New Orleans have shown that school choice works.

许多学校都掌握在美国教师工会手中，而教师工会又是最反对唯才是举教育几股力量之一，他们对任何良好的教育应当得到奖励或者坏教师应当被开除的暗示都持抵触的态度。为了修正这个问题以及有关教育投入不平等的传言，教育体系应当在强化当地性的同时，还要去当地化。对于学生的人均投入应当被设定为全州一个水准，并且应当向有利于穷人的方向倾斜。教育投入应当遵循学生的意愿，具体地说就是扩大教育券计划或者特许学校。如此，能够吸引更多学生的好学校会发展壮大，差的学校要么关门，要么被别人接手。教师工会和他们的民主党盟友会怒不可遏。但是，在破落的新奥尔良等城市进行的实验表明，选择学校是可行的。

Finally, America's universities need an injection of meritocracy. Only a handful, such as Caltech, admit applicants solely on academic merit. All should. And colleges should make more effort to offer value for money. With cheaper online courses gaining momentum, traditional institutions must cut costs or perish. The state can help by demanding more transparency from universities about the return that graduates earn on their degrees.

最后，美国大学需要注入一种唯才是举的精神。只有极少数的大学承认只有学业成绩的申请，如加州理工学院。所有的大学都应当如此。同时，美国大学还应当尽力让学费物有所值。鉴于费用更加便宜的在线课程正在形成势力，传统的院校必需削减成本，不然就生存不下去。各个州可以通过要求大学提高毕业生报酬透明度的方式来提供帮助。

Loosening the link between birth and success would make America richer—far too much talent is currently wasted. It might also make the nation more cohesive. If Americans suspect that the game is rigged, they may be tempted to vote for demagogues of the right or left—especially if the grown-up alternative is another Clinton or yet another Bush.

拆散出身和成功之间的联系会让美国更加富有——如今，太多有才华的人都被浪费了。它或许还能让这个国家变得更具凝聚力。如果美国人怀疑这是一场受人操纵的游戏，他们也许会情不自禁地把票投给那些或左或右的煽动者——尤其是在成熟的备选方案要么是另一位克林顿要么是另一位布什的时候。
