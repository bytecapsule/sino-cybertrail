(货币战争: 最终伊朗战争的爆发将标志着世界进入了一个"货币春秋战国"的新时代. 美国一旦陷入伊朗战争, 最终非但达不到控制世界石油"水龙头"的效果, 而且将迅速和无法逆转地耗尽仅存的维持世界独霸地位的金融实力. 世界各地的"觊觎"之徒将蜂拥而起. 

看看日本人的狡猾吧, ``What else can Japan do but to accept the request, once the oil producer sent its wish?''  好一副无辜的嘴脸, 日本暗地里操作日元作为石油结算货币又不是一天两天了, 这一回好不容易逮住了美国陷入空前的霸权和金融双重危机之中的机会, 终于促成了"石油日元"的梦想. 美国现在内心的痛苦和愤怒可能只有她自己知道. 

老欧洲那边则一邦紧似一邦地敲着美元的丧钟, 国际清算银行, 美国外交协会, 伦敦金融城深处的人则吹起了"黄金统一世界货币"的"冲锋号".

俄罗斯在忙着为卢布"梳洗打扮",  盘算着"世界货币"的卢布解决方案. 

石油生产国在观望之中抛弃美元, 犹疑于几种未来的选择之间.

大家内心都是一种激动, 不安和隐隐的窃喜, 每一次大的变动都会让人想入非非.

王位即将腾出来, 而王冠却只有一顶, 谁最有可能继承"货币大统"?

中国呢? 是在茫然麻木地昏睡, 还是深谋机巧地"守拙"? )

Iran Asks Japan to Pay Yen for Oil, Start Immediately  By Megumi Yamanaka July 13 (Bloomberg) -- Iran asked Japanese refiners to switch to the yen to pay for all crude oil purchases, after Iran's central bank said it is reducing holdings of the U.S. dollar.  

Iran wants yen-based transactions ``for any/all of your forthcoming Iranian crude oil liftings,'' according to a letter sent to Japanese refiners that was signed by Ali A. Arshi, general manager of crude oil marketing and exports in Tehran at the National Iranian Oil Co. The request is for all shipments ``effective immediately,'' according to the letter, dated July 10 and obtained by Bloomberg News.  

The yen rose on speculation for an increase in demand for the currency, the result of Japan's annual 1.24 trillion yen ($10.1 billion) of oil imports from Iran. Central bankers in Venezuela, Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates have said they will invest less of their reserves in dollar assets because of the weakening currency.  

``What else can Japan do but to accept the request, once the oil producer sent its wish?'' said Hirofumi Kawachi, an analyst at Mizuho Investors Securities Co. in Tokyo. ``The tensions between the U.S. and Iran are escalating, and it's Iran's measure to hedge risk.''  

A spokesman for Iran's oil ministry in Tehran said he could neither confirm nor deny that the letter had been sent. Most Japanese oil refiners have until now used U.S. dollars to pay Iran for oil, said the spokesman, who declined to be identified by name because of government policy.  

Yen Advances  

The yen advanced to 122.07 per dollar at 2:30 p.m. in New York, from 122.42 late yesterday.  

Iran is cutting its U.S. dollar reserves to less than 20 percent of total foreign currency holdings, and will buy more euros and yen as tensions with the U.S. increase, Central Bank Governor Ebrahim Sheibany said on March 27.  

The United Nations Security Council is preparing for another round of sanctions against Iran because of the nation's nuclear research.  

The Islamic republic, holder of the world's second-largest oil and gas reserves, has refused to halt uranium enrichment that it says is for use in nuclear power plants to produce electricity. The U.S. says Iran seeks instead to develop an atomic bomb. Enriched uranium can be used to make nuclear fuel or build nuclear weapons.  

Iran isn't alone in wanting to drop the dollar for pricing oil. Russia has been examining plans to price the Urals oil export blend in rubles to curb currency risks. The nation plans to open the Energy Stock Exchange in St. Petersburg in the first half of next year to trade oil in rubles, UBS AG reported June 14.  

`New Payment Mechanism'  

Iran asked the refiners to use the yen exchange rate quoted at the Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ on the date oil cargoes are loaded. The use of yen-based letters of credit for oil ``has finally been approved'' by the Iranian central bank and the NIOC, according to the letter, titled ``New payment mechanism for Iranian Crude Oil Cargoes.''  

Japan imported 1.59 million kiloliters of Iranian crude oil in May, the least since June 2006, according to government data.  

Only Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are larger oil suppliers to Japan than Iran.
