没有中间商赚差价，便宜能到你手里吗？

前几天有代理下单了一条三千多的高端鹅绒被，客户地址是南通的，家纺基地的大本营。代理略担心地问我，顾客会不会很容易去到批发市场比价？我让她放100个心，不会。这里面有很多门道可以讲。

首先呢，我现在合作的基本全部是供货实体的品牌工厂，批发商过去都是有门槛的，更不要提散客了。不说他们找不到，就是找到了也不接待的。此前就有一位老顾客，动心想在广西某县开家纺实体店来咨询我，结果她过去时我介绍的几个品牌工厂都不接待，很尴尬。

也有人就在南通周边，要结婚、搬家办大事，就想着自己直接去基地买，指望出厂价买好货。而实际是完完全全的南辕北辙。

能在基地开厂开门市的，个个都是久经生意场的人精，他们一眼就看得出来者是批发商还是散客....但凡是散客，99%会往死里宰。

好几年前，我就亲眼见证过。一对小情侣和父母走进我经常进货的枕芯工厂。那个接待客服简直让我开了眼，嘴巴比蜜甜，价格却似尖刀，比我的价格都翻倍。

最后四人选好6对枕芯付款时，客服小姐姐自己都不好意思地朝我吐舌头。一家人喜笑颜开出门时，客服小姐姐还每人塞了一瓶水，几颗糖......我心底直呼：离了大谱。

这只是枕芯，高端产品更是翻几倍宰。我的不少产品实拍图里，你们也能看到工厂的挂价是远高于我的价格的。

总之，散客想绕开中间商去基地捡便宜，起码家纺领域是行不通的。你们最容易找到的是某宝某多烂大街的超普货，而价格想捡便宜几乎没有可能。想出厂价捡高端货更是没可能。

再一个，不管代理还是顾客，有没有必要排斥一切中间商？做生意越久，我越觉得没必要。任何一个行业，任何一个工厂都是量决定价格和服务，你一个散客一个刚入行的代理，能有多少量。

哪怕千辛万苦真的给你找到源头，对方理不理你以及给你什么价格和服务都是未知的。没有量的时候，你拿到的价格可能比中间商给你的还高。或者需要你一次性囤货XX万。而中间商能帮你搞定的很多增值服务，你却享受不到了。

量在合作中有多大的决定性作用呢？

昨天大豆被的工厂给我发了一份检测报告，说是专门为我做的。因为前阵子我提出这款大豆被卖了七八年了，水洗标上适用的国标号有点老了，最好更新一下。我当时只是顺嘴提一下。没想到他们真的很快付诸行动去做检测、出报告，并告知我水洗标很快也会更新。

我感谢他们的时候，老板说，有问题你尽管提，我们会尽量配合。

看，这就是以量说话。

他家大豆被每年都是我的主打被芯，七八年卖下来说话自然就有了份量。

任何一个行业，都不要无端抵触中间商赚合理差价，或者奢望自己赚整个链条的钱，努力把自己的比较优势发挥到极致，协同合作，一起赚钱更健康。

Without middlemen to make the difference, can you get cheap?

A few days ago, an agent placed an order for a high-end goose down quilt of more than 3,000. The customer's address is Nantong, the base camp of the home textile base. The agent asked me with a little worry, will it be easy for customers to go to the wholesale market to compare prices? I asked her to put 100 heart, no. There are many ways to talk about it.

First of all, I am now basically cooperating with brand factories of supply entities. Wholesalers used to have thresholds, not to mention individual customers. Don't say they can't find it, even if they find it, they won't receive it. Before that, there was an old customer who wanted to open a home textile store in a county in Guangxi to consult me. As a result, several brand factories I introduced did not receive her in the past, which was very embarrassing.

There are also people around Nantong who want to get married and move to do big things. They want to go directly to the base to buy and expect to buy good goods at the ex-factory price. And the reality is completely different.

Those who can open factories and markets in the base are all experienced businessmen. They can tell at a glance whether they are wholesalers or individual customers .... But 99% of individual customers will die.

I witnessed it several years ago. A small couple and their parents walked into the pillow core factory where I often stock. The reception customer service simply opened my eyes. My mouth was sweeter than honey, but the price was like a sharp knife, double my price.

When the last four people chose 6 pairs of pillow cores to pay, the customer service sister herself was embarrassed to stick out her tongue at me. When the family went out with a smile, the customer service sister also stuffed each with a bottle of water and a few candies... From the bottom of my heart, I called out: I left the big spectrum.

This is only the pillow core, high-end products are several times more slaughter. Many of my products are actually photographed, and you can also see that the factory's hanging price is much higher than my price.

In short, individual customers want to bypass middlemen to go to the base to pick up cheap, at least the home textile field is not feasible. The easiest thing for you to find is the super-common goods on a certain bad street, and it is almost impossible to get a cheap price. It is even more impossible to pick up high-end goods at ex-factory prices.

Another, whether agents or customers, is it necessary to exclude all intermediaries? The longer we do business, the more I feel unnecessary. In any industry, any factory determines the price and service by quantity. How much quantity can you have as an individual customer and an agent who has just entered the industry.

Even if you really find the source after all the hardships, the other party will ignore you and what price and service they will give you are unknown. When there is no quantity, the price you get may be higher than what the middleman gives you. Or you need to stock up XX million at one time. However, many value-added services that middlemen can help you with are not available to you.

How decisive is volume in cooperation?

Yesterday, the soybean quilt factory sent me a test report, saying it was specially made for me. Because I suggested a while ago that this soybean has been sold for seven or eight years, the applicable national label on the washing label is a bit old, so it is better to update it. I was just mentioning it. I didn't expect them to take action to do the test and report soon, and told me that the washing label would be updated soon.

When I thanked them, the boss said, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask and we will try our best to cooperate.

See, this is talking in terms of volume.

His soybean is my main quilt core every year, and when it is sold in 1978, it naturally carries weight.

In any industry, don't resist middlemen for no reason to earn a reasonable price difference, or expect yourself to earn the money of the whole chain, and strive to maximize your comparative advantage, cooperate and make money healthier together.
