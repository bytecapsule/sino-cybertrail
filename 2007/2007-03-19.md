The Slow-Motion Stock Market Crash

股票市场的慢性崩溃by Robert Kiyosaki

When my book "Rich Dad's Prophecy" was released in 2002, most financial newspapers and magazines trashed it because I discussed a looming stock market crash. Ironically, much of what I predicted in the book is coming true earlier than I expected.

当我的书《富爸爸：大预言》在2002年出版的时候，大部分财经报纸和杂志都把它视为垃圾，因为我讨论了一个正在逼近的股市崩溃。具有讽刺意味的是，大部分我书中预言的东西正在比我预计的更早的成为现实。

On Feb. 27 of this year, a 9 percent market sell-off in China sent ripples of fear through stocks markets across the world. In the United States, the Dow's one-day plunge of 416 points was the steepest decline since the market opened after Sept. 11, 2001.

在今年的2月27日，中国的股票市场下跌9个百分点，给全世界的股票市场带来一丝恐惧。在美国，道琼斯指数一天下跌416点，这是911以来最剧烈的一次下跌。

So the question is: Should stock investors be worried? As you might expect, some say yes and some say no.

所以问题是：股票投资者需要感到焦虑吗？ 正如你可能预料的，一些人说会，而一些人说不会。

Correction or Crash?

回落还是崩溃？

Personally, if I were counting on the stock market for my retirement or to put my kids through college, I'd be worried. Why? Because from my perspective, even if the Dow were to miraculously soar through 15,000, the stock market has been experiencing a long, slow crash for years.

从个人角度讲，如果我是指望股票市场来退休或者把我孩子送到大学，我可能会焦虑。为什么？ 因为从我的预言中，即使道琼斯指数彪升到15000点，股票市场同样在经历着一次长时间的，长达数年的缓慢崩溃。

This February, investors witnessed a drop of $583 billion in U.S. market wealth. Many experts are quick to point out that this loss of wealth is a mere drop in the bucket when you take into account that the stock market has been going up for four years. Most market experts say that the market was due for a correction, which is true.

今天二月，投资者目睹了美国股市市值缩水了5830亿美元，许多专家迅速指出，当你考虑到股票市场已经上涨了四年，这种市值的损失只是冰山一角。大部分市场专家认为市场应该有一次回落，这是正确的。In fact, the recent 3.5 percent drop is miniscule when compared to the 21 percent drop of the S&P 500 back in 1987. By definition, such a small drop isn't even classified as a true correction. According to BusinessWeek, a full-fledged correction is defined as a 10 percent drop, and a bear market is defined as a 20 percent drop.

事实上，最近3.5个百分点的下跌，在和1987年S&P500(斯坦福五百种股票指数)的21％的下跌相比确实只能算小意思。一般概念中，这种小的下跌甚至不会被认为是一次真正的回落。参考一个交易周，一次完整的，10个百分点的下跌（在空头市场20%的下跌）才能算作一次回落。

Comparing Apples to Oranges比较苹果和桔子

So how can I say that the market is crashing even if it continues to go up? To see the true crash, educated investors need to compare apples to oranges, not apples to apples.

我是如何能说这个市场即使继续增长也是在崩溃呢？要看到真正的崩溃，受过教育的投资者应该去用苹果来比较桔子，而不是用苹果来比较苹果。

When you compare the Dow to the Dow, or the S&P 500 to the S&P 500, that's comparing apples to apples. The Dow at 12,000 appears better than the Dow at 9,000, just as an apple at $1 a pound looks better than at $1.50 a pound, even though it's still the same apple. All that's happened is the price per pound of the apple has gone up -- the apple hasn't changed.

当我用道指和道指比较，或者用斯坦福500和斯坦福500比较，那就是用苹果来比较苹果。 道指在12000点就显示出比9000点的时候好，就象苹果一磅1美元比一磅1.5美元要好一样，即使他们是同一个苹果。所发生的是苹果的每磅的价格在上升，苹果本身没有变化。

Years ago, my rich dad taught me to be a comparison shopper, especially when it comes to investments. He said, "You need to understand value more than price. Just because the price of something goes up doesn't necessarily mean the value has gone up."

很多年前，我的富爸爸教我做一个会比较的购物者，特别是在进行投资的时候。 他说，“你需要了解价值更甚于了解价格”。因为一些东西价格的上升并不意味着他的价值也上升了。

He also told me, "If prices go up without a corresponding increase in value, it means the value of the asset has actually gone down." This holds true for all assets, including stocks, bonds, and real estate.

他还告诉我，“如果在没有相应价值上升的的时候，价格上升了，这意味着这个资产的价值下降了”，这在任何资产上都有效，包括股票，债券和房地产。

For example, when the price of a house goes up it doesn't mean that the house is more valuable. And prices going up may mean that something else is going down in value. In today's global markets, what's going down is the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar.

举个例子，当房子的价格上升，并不意味着房子更有价值了。 而且价格的上升某些方面意味着价值下降了。 在今天的全球市场，正在下降的东西就是美元的购买力。

The Dow vs. Gold

道指 VS 黄金

To get a truer picture of comparative values, compare the Dow to the price of gold. When the purchasing power of gold is compared to the purchasing power of the Dow, the Dow appears to be crashing.

为了获取关于价值的更真实的图像，来比较道指和黄金的价格。 当用黄金的购买力来和道指的购买力比较，道指就显示出崩溃了。

That means the average investor will need at least a 15 percent annual return on their stocks or mutual funds just to stay ahead of the U.S. dollar's purchasing power erosion -- that is, just to break even.

这意味着一般投资者需要用至少15%的收入返还在他们的股票或者共同基金上，来延缓美元购买力的贬值 ——— 而且这还只是刚刚打个平手。In my earlier Yahoo! Finance columns, I used history to forecast the future by comparing the dollar to gold and oil over a 10-year period. Here's the data:

在我早期的YAHOO财经栏目中，我通过比较10年周期中的美元和黄金，石油，用历史来预测未来，这是数据。 19962006Percent Increase 增长百分比Oil石油$10/barrel 10美元/桶$60/barrel 60美元/桶500Gold黄金$275/ounce 275美元/盎司$600/ounce 600美元/盎司118Table updated 3/21/07.

What Next?

下一步是什么？

What this means for you depends upon your bullish or bearish outlook, your financial education, and financial experience. For example, I hear many young people today saying that the price of real estate doesn't go down. This is a naive opinion due to lack of financial education and experience. I heard similar misguided opinions about stocks in the dotcom era, just before the market crashed.

这对你来说意味着什么取决于你用熊市还是牛市的眼光看问题，你的经济学教育和经济学经验。 举个例子，我听说很多现在的年轻人说房地产的价格不会下降，这是缺乏经济学教育和经济学经验的一种天真的念头。我在.com热潮中听到类似的被误导的观点，直到市场崩溃。

Personally, I tend to heed former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's caution about a possible recession ahead. I predict that if there is a recession, current Fed chairman Ben Bernanke (and, in an attempt to hold onto the White House, the Republicans) will flood the market with more money at lower interest rates.

从个人角度，我倾向于留意前联邦储备委员会主席 阿兰.格林斯潘的对不久可能的衰退的警告。 我预言如果有这样一个衰退，现任联邦储备委员会主席 本.伯南克会用很低的利率向市场上注入更多的资金。Then the purchasing power of the dollar will once again drop, asset prices may rise, and the financially naive will actually believe that the value of their assets -- houses, stocks, and mutual funds -- have gone up in value.

那时，美元的购买力会再一次下跌，资产的价格会回升，那时那些在经济学上天真的人们会真的相信他们资产的价值－－房子，股票，共同基金－－在价值上已经升值了。
