苹果公司的入职欢迎信

There's work and there's your life's work.

The kind of work that has your fingerprints all over it. The kind of work that you'd never compromise on. That you'd sacrifice a weekend for. 

You can do that kind of work at Apple. People don't come here to play it safe. They come here to swim in the deep end.

They want their work to add up to something.Something big. Something that couldn't happen anywhere else.

Welcome to Apple.
