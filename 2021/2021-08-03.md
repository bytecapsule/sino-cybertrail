中国为什么要爆锤自己的科技企业？

这个博客还不错：https://noahpinion.substack.com/

怎么理解中国近期对多家大型企业/行业的监管措施？长期为彭博社供稿的独立经济学评论作者Noah Smith写了一篇分析，有一些有意思的观点。全文很长，所以我摘取了部分重点内容翻译如下：

关注商业新闻的人可能注意到一个有趣而奇怪的现象：在过去几个月中，中国正对自己的互联网公司重拳出击。对于许多置身于中国之外的人来说，很看清楚到底发生了什么。有观察人士认为，这是一场“反垄断运动”，正如美国和欧盟正在进行的一样——美国新反垄断运动背后的驱动力之一，是为了遏制这些大型科技公司的政治权力。

然而，中国的行动有一个重大差异：美国曾打击过几家公司巨头——微软、AT&T、标准石油等——但它最终并没有使这些公司所属的行业受到重创。我们也不太可能看到美国政府同时针对所有美国互联网公司的行动。

相比而言，中国的行动覆盖的面似乎要更广——看起来，它的对象不仅仅是那些最大的互联网公司，还有整个行业。（这里的一个重要证据是，中国似乎也在减少在该领域的风险投资。如果仅希望有更多竞争，就不会压制新的进入者。）

这非常奇怪，因为这么多年来，西方媒体的传统观点是，拥有一个“科技”行业对创新和增长都非常重要。尽管很多美国专家一度认为，中国很难建立起世界级的互联网科技行业，但无论如何，中国后来确实做到了，那么，为什么它现在会故意地打击这个它自己建立起的行业呢？

值得注意的是：中国最近的举措并针对所有的科技企业——华为仍然得到政府的全力支持；中国政府正在全力以赴，试图创建一个世界级的半导体行业，并为此投入巨额资金；中国同样继续在人工智能领域投入巨资——可以看出，中国“打击”的不是科技，而是被美国人贴上“科技”标签的、实质上是面向消费的互联网软件公司。

为什么美国人把“科技”等同于谷歌、亚马逊和脸书这样的公司？一个原因是，消费互联网行业是美国真正擅长的领域——与电子硬件行业不同，消费软件是亚洲竞争对手尚未能击败美国的领域。

另一个原因是，软件公司利润丰厚：2020年，脸书的利润超过180亿美元，是思科的6倍，霍尼韦尔的3倍。而由于美国常常倾向于将利润等同于价值，所以也就认为，面向消费的软件行业是美国的行业冠军，并为国家创造了巨大的经济价值。

然而，中国可能对此有不同的看法。中国政府可能认为，互联网巨头的利润更多来自租金，而不是实际增值——他们只是蹲在非生产性的“数字土地”上，利用先发优势来获取强大的网络效应。

事实上，我也对“把消费互联网技术认定为最高形式的技术”这样一种观点感到很奇怪，因为我不认为脸书、Snap等应用程序在“技术推动文明”方面做了最重要的工作。反之，它们可能在这方面还产生了一些负面影响：比如，它们开发的应用程序提供了有趣的、但拖累生产力的干扰；这些公司把原本可能投身于材料科学或半导体制造的聪明孩子吸引到了广告优化和游戏开发领域。

大量玩游戏、在互联网上购买家庭用品、订购食品外卖，并不能让一个国家成为技术或科学领域的领导者——这些当然都是优秀的公司，但在我看来，我们技术文明的“里程碑”应当建立在科学和工业成就中。

在过去几个月中，中国高层很明显已经转向这样一种观点：硬技术（hard tech）比那些让我们更深入数字世界的产品更有价值。换句话说，中国对互联网行业的监管是其国家新兴产业政策的一部分，他们试图引导国家的工业结构，朝着他们认为能为整个国家服务的方向发展。

什么是能为整个国家服务的东西？我猜测是，地缘政治和军事力量，尤其是相对于其他对手国家的力量。

现在的美国人很容易忘记这一点：曾经，“有赢得战争的能力”也是我们技术创新的驱动目标，国防支出在传统上一直是美国政府科研支出的一个巨大组成部分，而在某种程度上，许多美国最成功的私营科技行业是这些国防努力的“副产品”。

但冷战之后，美国的优先事项从“生存”（survival）转向了“享受”（enjoyment）。像脸书和亚马逊这样的技术，从根本上来讲，就是休闲和消费，但它们从一个“有趣、有利可图的副产品”逐渐变成了的美国人心中的“技术中心”。

然而，中国从未真正从“生存”模式中走出过。是的，中国欢迎经济增长，不过这种增长总是朝着综合国力的目标前进。中国年轻人可能越来越倾向于套现、享受一些乐趣了，但中国高层并不是这样，他们有更重要的事情去做：一血之前的“百年屈辱”，或者为中国要求一个更合理的国际地位等等。

Why is China smashing its tech industry? 

Maybe because what countries think of as a "tech industry" isn't always the same 

Those who pay attention to business news have probably noted an interesting and curious phenomenon over the past few months: China is smashing its internet companies. It started — or at least, most people in the U.S. started noticing it — when the government effectively canceled the IPO of Ant Financial, then dismantled the company. Jack Ma, the founder of Ant and of e-commerce giant Alibaba, was summoned to a meeting with the government and then disappeared for weeks.

The government then levied a multi-billion dollar antitrust fine against Alibaba (which is sometimes compared to Amazon), deleted its popular web browser from app stores, and took a bunch of other actions against it. The value of Ma’s business empire has collapsed.

But Ma was only the most prominent target. The government is also going after other fintech companies, including those owned by Didi (China’s Uber) and Tencent (China’s biggest social media company). As Didi prepared to IPO in the U.S., Chinese regulators announced they were reviewing the company on “national security grounds”, and are now levying various penalties against it.

The government has also embarked on an “antitrust” push, fining Tencent and Baidu — two other top Chinese internet companies — for various past deals. Leaders of top tech companies (also including ByteDance, the company that owns TikTok) were summoned before regulators and presumably berated.

Various Chinese tech companies are now undergoing “rectification”.

For those outside China’s byzantine, opaque nexus of party, government, and big business, it’s very difficult to figure out what’s going on. Just who is ordering these actions is not clear, or what the ultimate result of the crackdown will be. That makes it very hard to figure out why it’s happening.

Some observers see this as an antitrust campaign, similar to the ones going on in the U.S. or the EU. China’s leaders famously want to prevent the emergence of alternative centers of power, but is the West so different in this regard?

One of the driving motivations behind the new antitrust movement in the U.S. is to curb the political power of Big Tech companies specifically; if you wanted to, you might see the Chinese tech crackdown as simply a Neo-Brandeisian movement on steroids.

But the breadth of the Chinese crackdown suggests a major difference. The U.S. has slapped down a few of its corporate giants before — Microsoft, AT&T, Standard Oil — but ultimately it didn’t crush the industries these companies were a part of. We’re unlikely to see major action against all the U.S. internet companies at once, and broad EU action will likely take the form of new rules rather than a sweeping crackdown.

China’s attack on its tech companies, in contrast, seems far more comprehensive — it’s not just attacking the biggest internet companies, it’s attacking the entire sector. (Update: An important piece of evidence here is that China also appears to be reducing venture funding. If you want more competition you don't squash new entrants!) 

For whatever reason, China is suddenly not a fan of the industry we call “tech”.

This is strange because for years, it was conventional wisdom in the Western media that having a “tech” sector was crucial to innovation and growth etc. In fact, for many years American pundits argued that China’s economy would be held back by the government’s insistence on control of information, because it would make it impossible for China to build a world-class tech sector!

Then China did build a world-class tech sector anyway, and now it’s willfully smashing the world-class tech sector it built. So much for U.S.-style “innovation”.

But notice that China isn’t cracking down on all of its technology companies. Huawei, for example, still seems to enjoy the government’s full backing. The government is going hell-bent-for-leather to try to create a world-class domestic semiconductor industry, throwing huge amounts of money at even the most speculative startups.

And it’s still spending heavily on A.I. It’s not technology that China is smashing — it’s the consumer-facing internet software companies that Americans tend to label “tech”.

Why do Americans equate “tech” with companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook, anyway? One reason is that the consumer internet industry is something America is really good at — unlike our electronics hardware industries, consumer software is something that hard-driving Asian competitors haven’t yet been able to beat us at.

Another reason is that software companies make a lot of profit — Facebook made over $18 billion in 2020, three times Micron or Honeywell and six times Cisco. With their low overhead, network effects, troves of intellectual property, strong brand value, and differentiated products, successful software companies naturally tend to generate high margins.

That’s true for smaller software companies as well as big ones. And since in America we often tend to equate profit with value, this means we think of the consumer-facing software industry as being our industrial champion, generating a huge amount of economic value for our nation.

China may simply see things differently. It’s possible that the Chinese government has decided that the profits of companies like Alibaba and Tencent come more from rents than from actual value added — that they’re simply squatting on unproductive digital land, by exploiting first-mover advantage to capture strong network effects, or that the IP system is biased to favor these companies, or something like that.

There are certainly those in America who believe that Facebook and Google produce little of value relative to the profit they rake in; maybe China’s leaders, for reasons that will remain forever opaque to us, have simply reached the same conclusion.

But in fact I suspect that there is something else going on here. If you’re interested in China and its economy, one analyst you should definitely read is GaveKal Dragonomics’ Dan Wang. And in Dan’s 2019 letter, I noticed the following passage: 

I find it bizarre that the world has decided that consumer internet is the highest form of technology. It’s not obvious to me that apps like WeChat, Facebook, or Snap are doing the most important work pushing forward our technologically-accelerating civilization. 

To me, it’s entirely plausible that Facebook and Tencent might be net-negative for technological developments. The apps they develop offer fun, productivity-dragging distractions; and the companies pull smart kids from R&D-intensive fields like materials science or semiconductor manufacturing, into ad optimization and game development.

The internet companies in San Francisco and Beijing are highly skilled at business model innovation and leveraging network effects, not necessarily R&D and the creation of new IP. I wish we would drop the notion that China is leading in technology because it has a vibrant consumer internet.

A large population of people who play games, buy household goods online, and order food delivery does not make a country a technological or scientific leader. These are fine companies, but in my view, the milestones of our technological civilization ought to be found in scientific and industrial achievements instead.

Dan’s job is to keep his ear to the ground, figure out what the movers and shakers in China think, and relay those thoughts to us. So when he started talking about the idea that consumer internet tech isn’t real “tech”, I immediately wondered if China’s leaders were thinking along the same lines. And then in his 2020 letter, Dan wrote: 

It’s become apparent in the last few months that the Chinese leadership has moved towards the view that hard tech is more valuable than products that take us more deeply into the digital world. Xi declared this year that while digitization is important, “we must recognize the fundamental importance of the real economy… and never deindustrialize.”

This expression preceded the passage of securities and antitrust regulations, thus also pummeling finance, which along with tech make up the most glamorous sectors today.

In other words, the crackdown on China’s internet industry seems to be part of the country’s emerging national industrial policy. Instead of simply letting local governments throw resources at whatever they think will produce rapid growth (the strategy in the 90s and early 00s), China’s top leaders are now trying to direct the country’s industrial mix toward what they think will serve the nation as a whole. 

And what do they think will serve the nation as a whole? My guess is: Power. Geopolitical and military power for the People’s Republic of China, relative to its rival nations. 

If you’re going to fight a cold war or a hot war against the U.S. or Japan or India or whoever, you need a bunch of military hardware. That means you need materials, engines, fuel, engineering and design, and so on. You also need chips to run that hardware, because military tech is increasingly software-driven. And of course you need firmware as well.

You’ll also need surveillance capability, for keeping an eye on your opponents, for any attempts you make to destabilize them, and for maintaining social control in case they try to destabilize you.

It’s easy for Americans to forget this now, but there was a time when “ability to win wars” was the driving goal of technological innovation. The NDRC and the OSRD were the driving force behind government sponsorship of research and technology in World War 2, and the NSF and DARPA grew out of this tradition.

Defense spending has traditionally been a huge component of government research-spending in the U.S., and many of America’s most successful private-sector tech industries are in some way spinoffs of those defense-related efforts.

After the Cold War, our priorities shifted from survival to enjoyment. Technologies like Facebook and Amazon.com, which are fundamentally about leisure and consumption, went from being fun and profitable spinoffs of defense efforts to the center of what Americans thought of as “tech”. 

But China never really shifted out of survival mode. Yes, China’s leaders embraced economic growth, but that growth has always been toward the telos of comprehensive national power. China’s young people may be increasingly ready to cash out and have some fun, but the leadership is just not there yet. They’ve got bigger fish to fry — they have to avenge the Century of Humiliation and claim China’s rightful place in the sun and blah blah. 

And so when China’s leaders look at what kind of technologies they want the country’s engineers and entrepreneurs to be spending their effort on, they probably don’t want them spending that effort on stuff that’s just for fun and convenience. They probably took a look at their consumer internet sector and decided that the link between that sector and geopolitical power had simply become too tenuous to keep throwing capital and high-skilled labor at it.

And so, in classic CCP fashion, it was time to smash.

Updates: 

My theory also helps explain why China would suddenly smash its for-profit education sector, though I’m sure there are other reasons too. 

Another factor some have suggested (see the comment section) is that the consumer internet companies that China is penalizing have large degrees of foreign ownership. So it could also partially be about denying foreigners a toehold in Chinese tech. 

As always, there are people with different interpretations of events presented here. Here is one such contrary view, arguing that China’s actions against tech companies are done mainly with the interests of consumers in mind.

Here is another, better-argued version of that view. I am not particularly persuaded by this; I think any assessment of China’s government’s objectives that doesn’t recognize the central importance of comprehensive national power is probably being a bit too diplomatic.

Yes, China wants to be a “manufacturing superpower”, but it has reasons for doing so that go far beyond providing people with good manufacturing jobs.

Meanwhile, shares of China’s semiconductor champion, SMIC, are surging, as my theory would predict:

China's top semiconductor company, SMIC, is up 20% (the daily limit) in Shanghai trading on Tuesday. This is the flipside of the crackdown.

The immediate impetus for the surge was apparently a rumor of a big order from Huawei, a company that some believe is deeply intertwined with the Chinese military. 

Meanwhile, at least a few more knowledgeable observers than myself seem to be thinking along the same lines as I did:
