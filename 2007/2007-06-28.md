货币战争点评<国家货币的终结>

我们完全能够想象当人们第一次看到<货币战争>提出恢复黄金的货币地位和主张"藏金于民"时, 会是多么惊讶和迷惑. 我们也要明确指出<货币战争>是要揭露国际银行家的阴谋, 而不是这个阴谋的一部分.

从博客的留言和网友的争辩来看, 金本位是人们争议最剧烈反对意见最集中的问题之一.  为什么国内的学者和老百姓对黄金的认识与黄金的真实价值会有如此之大的落差呢? 我们觉得问题有两个方面, 一是"信息不对称", 二是"文化软骨病". 

关于黄金货币的论述古今中外可谓汗牛充栋, 只要认真研究货币历史, 你总能找到几乎是无穷无尽的关于金银货币的观点. 中国文革结束以来, 整个知识界充满了一种偏执情绪, 他们对所有的源于欧美的"主流"学说几乎没有任何怀疑和批判的全面接受, 与国际接轨的欲望和幻觉几近歇斯底里. 其中, 尤其是"崇美症"已经完全属于病态心理了. 我们不是站立着平视对方, 我们也不是坐着仰视别人, 我们是五体投地般趴在地上连抬头的勇气都没有. 中国在1840年鸦片战争以来的一系列惨败之后, 几乎完全丧失了对自己文明的自信心. 1949年以来, 中国虽然在军事上, 政治上和经济上站立起来了, 但在文化上始终严重缺钙, 我们事实上只有"三个半"站起来了.

对于美元这种纯债务纸币系统, 我们的经济学家就没有丝毫的质疑? 稍微研究一下货币历史就会发现, 这和历代各国君主不断减少货币含金量从而搜刮财富和逃避债务没有任何本质区别, 现代科技的发达并不能减少人们哪怕一丁点儿的本性的贪婪. 谁发行货币, 只要有机会就一定会舞弊, 而且这种舞弊行为必然像吸毒一般上瘾, 直至最后货币体系崩溃. 奇怪的是, 当今中国的许多人认为美国或所谓西方民主社会, 或所谓希腊文明的火种, 或罗马帝国的后裔能够免俗, 这种认识就是典型的"五体投地"式软骨病的典型症状. 

法国著名经济学家雅克・吕埃夫写道，这个体系(美元本位)“达到了如此荒诞的程度，以致有推理能力的任何人脑都无法为其辩解。” 难道只有法国人有智力理解这一制度的荒谬? 当然不是, 中国的学者有能力分析, 却没有胆量怀疑!

可以这么说, 所有基于黄金增长赶不上财富增长, 金本位必然导致经济衰退等等观点从金融的本质上看都是荒谬的. 关于货币起源和本质的问题, 金本位问题, 我们正在写, 这将是<中国对策篇>的开篇内容.

我们早就断言, 世界上有少数人在悄悄地吸纳黄金和白银, 谁拥有最多的黄金, 谁就拥有真正的货币定价权! 过去如此, 现在如此, 未来仍将如此. 罗斯切尔德家族垄断国际黄金定价权直到2004年才主动"隐退",  那些认为谁都能定世界金价的中国富豪们, 不妨自己试试看. 尽管从财务上看, 很多中国富豪已经远比罗斯切尔德家族"富有", 可惜人家却在制定财富游戏的规则. 

"但私营的黄金银行已经存在，从而使账户的持有者可以用真实的金条作为股份的形式，进行国际支付。虽然黄金银行业目前显然是小本生意，但随着美元的衰落，它近年来有了显著的增长。如果谈论一种基于黄金的新的国际货币体系，肯定听起来很离谱。但1900年时，一个没有黄金的货币体系也是如此。现代科技使得通过私营黄金银行恢复黄金货币成为可能，即使没有政府的支持也是如此。"

这篇文章就看这一段就足够了, 这就是画龙点睛之处, 也正是文章全部重心之所在. 翻译成大家能理解的话就是, 废除各国中央银行, 消灭主权货币, 实施以黄金为核心的世界统一货币! 

那中国的1.2万亿的美元外汇储备怎么办? 中国仅有650吨黄金储备又怎么办? 我觉得中国很可能最终会损失惨重. 

有人会认为, 美国决不会放弃美元的, 一篇文章没有什么值得大惊小怪的. 问题是美元崩溃对中国的影响要大得多, 别忘了美国是世界第一大黄金储备国, 至少公开报道是如此. 赖掉所有债务之后(通过严重的通货膨胀), 以黄金做支撑发行新货币(如世界货币), 美国还是超级强国, 中国就惨了, 辛辛苦苦30年的积蓄就烟消云散了, 可能还会摊上严重的金融风暴和社会骚乱.

发表文章的<外交事物>和美国外交协会可不是在开玩笑, 联系最近一系列文章和事件, 这篇文章不能算是孤立的偶然的学术观点.

国家货币的终结 The End Of National Currency 【本刊讯】5月9日出版的美国《外交》双月刊刊登了美国外交关系委员会国际经济部主任本・斯泰尔撰写的一篇文章，题为《国家货币的终结》，摘要如下：

货币国家主义的崛起 资本的流动已经成为全球化唯一致命的弱点。25年来，毁灭性的货币危机袭击了拉美和亚洲的各个国家，以及西欧的邻近国家，尤其是俄罗斯和土耳其。就连美国联邦储备委员会理事米什金这样一位支持全球化的、资历无可挑剔的经济学家也承认：“向外国资本流动开放金融体系导致了造成巨大痛苦、苦难乃至暴力的一些灾难性的金融危机。”

经济学这个专业一直未能提供应付货币危机的前后一致的和令人信服的对策。国际货币基金组织的分析人员20年来一直支持采取范围广泛的各种国家汇率和货币政策制度。但是后来，这些制度却遭到了崩溃和失败。他们指出了一个个罪魁祸首，从缺乏严谨的财政政策和对银行的管制不善到糟糕的产业政策和官员的腐败都有。根据有关金融危机的文献提出的政策建议瞻前顾后，而且遭到了普遍的批驳，因而实际上毫无用处。

反对全球化的经济学家们赦免了各国政府的罪责（华盛顿的政府除外），而是把爆发危机的罪责推给市场及其制度支持者，譬如国际货币基金组织――用诺贝尔奖获得者约瑟夫・斯蒂格利茨的话说，就是“国际金融的独裁机构”――从而使这个问题颠倒过来。斯蒂格利茨写道：“各国实际上被告知，如果它们不遵守某些条件，资本市场或者国际货币基金组织就会拒绝向它们提供贷款。它们基本上被迫放弃了自己的部分主权。”

这对吗？市场是否失灵？使各国政府恢复丧失的主权是否会制止金融动荡？这是一种危险的误诊。实际上，只有在各国开始要求获得货币方面的“主权”――使之与黄金或者被看作真实财富的任何别的东西相分离――之后，资本的流动才开始破坏稳定。此外，即使全球化的进军并非不可避免，由于世界经济和国际金融体系的演变方式，也不再有超出其范围的经济发展的一种可行的模式。

正确的方针不是回到享有货币主权的神话般的过去，使政府控制本国的利率和汇率，享受着对世界其余地方的无知的快乐。各国政府必须放弃一种致命的观念，就是认为国家特征要求它们制造和控制在本国领土上使用的货币。简单地讲，国家的货币和全球市场是不能相互混杂的，如果混合在一起，就形成货币危机和地缘政治紧张关系的致命混杂，为具有破坏性的保护主义创造现成的借口。为了安全地实现全球化，各国应当放弃货币国家主义，废除不必要的货币，因为它们是今天的许多动荡的根源。

黄金时代 在上一个“全球化”伟大时期之中，就是从19世纪末到第一次世界大战爆发，资本的流量是巨大的，即使按照当代的标准衡量也是如此。这一时期发生了货币危机，但一般并不严重，而且很短暂。这是因为当时的货币――就像在全世界大多数国家和绝大部分人类历史上一样――是黄金，或者起码是对黄金的一种可信的索取权。资金迅速地流回到陷入危机的国家，因为人们对货币与黄金之间的联系将会恢复笃信不疑。与此同时，货币国家主义被认为是落后的迹象，而遵守举世公认的价值标准则是文明的标志。在遵守这一标准方面最值得信赖的国家（譬如澳大利亚、加拿大和美国）所受到的奖赏是最低的国际贷款价格。而遵守情况最差的国家（譬如阿根廷、巴西和智利）所受到的惩罚则是最高的贷款价格。

在一战到二战期间，这种联系遭到了致命的破坏。20世纪30年代和40年代的大多数经济学家都认为，资本的流动显然将会由于汇率不再在可靠的情况下得到固定而对稳定起破坏作用。在1937年的一次演讲中，弗里德里希・哈耶克说，在值得信赖的金本位制度下，“短期资本流动总的来说倾向于缓解国际收支暂时的不利状况的初始原因所造成的紧张。然而，如果汇率是可变的，则资本的转移就会倾向于在这一初始原因的相同方向上进行，因而使之得到加强”――就像今天的情况一样。

普遍的看法曾经是，全球化必须有硬通货，就是外国人愿意持有的某种东西。法国经济学家查尔斯・李斯特评论说：“虽然理论家试图说服公众和各国政府，使之相信最低数量的黄金……就足以维持人们对货币的信心，而且无论如何，纸币，甚至不兑现纸币也可以满足一切需要，但是所有国家的公众都在忙着囤积据说可以兑换成黄金的大量国家货币。”持这一观点的并非局限于自由市场派人士。金本位和全球资本主义的著名批评者卡尔・波拉尼认为，货币国家主义显然与全球化水火不相容。在重点论述英国19世纪在扩大世界贸易方面的兴趣的时候，他争论说：“只有商品货币能够服务于这一目的，其明显的原因是，符号货币，不论是银行票据还是不兑现纸币，都不能在外国领土上流通。”但波拉尼认为是无稽之谈的事情――以毫无内在价值的国家纸币（或“不兑现”纸币）为中介的、货物、劳务和资本方面的全球贸易――就是全球化今天像以往一样断断续续地推进的方式。

把货币的创造和控制与国家主权联系起来的政治神话在著名的“最优货币区”理论的蜕变中，找到了其在经济上的对应物。该理论是获得诺贝尔奖的经济学家罗伯特・ 蒙代尔开创的。他长期以来一直是减少国家货币数量主张的一位多产的倡导者。这项理论在以后几十年里成为货币国家主义的一项准科学的基础。

像20世纪60年代初的大多数宏观经济学家一样，蒙代尔持有一种现已基本上丧失信誉的战后凯恩斯主义思维定式，他所笃信不疑的是，决策者在面临经济学家所说的对供求的“冲击”的情况下微调国民需求的能力。他的开创性文章《最优货币区理论》中提出的问题是：“货币区的适当范畴是什么？”他评论说：“乍一看来，这个问题也许是单纯学术性的，因为国家货币是否有朝一日会被放弃，让位于任何其它的安排，这一点看来并不属于政治可行性的范畴。”

蒙代尔接着主张在世界上的各个地区之间实行弹性汇率，在每个地区实行本地区的多国货币，而不是在国家之间。然而，经济学家们接受了蒙代尔对弹性汇率在解决对不同的“地区或者国家”产生不同影响的经济冲击问题方面的利弊的分析。他们认为，这是把现有的国家当作自然的货币区域来对待的一项理由。因此货币国家主义获得了合理的科学依据。从那时起，许多主流经济学家逐渐认识到，偏离“一个国家一种货币”的主张是错误的，起码在没有事先的政治一体化的情况下是如此。

由于经济学家们确立了货币和国家特征之间的联系（就像中世纪的神学家使亚里士多德和耶稣得到调和一样），所以各国政府采纳了最优货币区理论，作为对货币国家主义的主要的知识辩解。

发展中国家的政府一贯对利率、贷款的到期日，甚至还有信用的受益者实行严格的控制――因为所有这一切都要求切断与世界其余国家的金融和货币联系，并严格控制国际资本流动。其结果是，这种流动的发生主要是为了解决贸易失衡或者为直接投资而融资。而本国的金融体系却仍然薄弱和欠发达。但今天的经济增长越来越多地有赖于做出投资决策。这种决策通过全球金融体系来融资和制订。（通过低成本的日元借贷，以便为在欧洲的投资提供资金，同时在美国的期货交易所针对日元的升值采取对冲措施，这已经不再是异乎寻常的。）因此，这个全球体系的不加限制和高效率的准入，而不是各国政府操纵狭隘的货币政策的能力，对于未来的经济发展来说已经变得至关重要。

但是，由于外国人往往不愿意持有发展中国家的货币，所以这些国家本国的金融体系结果基本上被孤立在全球体系之外。它们的利率往往大大高于国际市场，其贷放活动往往非常短暂――在大多数情况下只有几个月。其结果是，许多发展中国家都依赖美元获得长期信贷。因此，资本的流动变得很危险，不论有多么必要：在发展中国家，一旦货币贬值，本国人和外国人都迫不及待地打量抛售本国货币，因为货币的贬值使得该国更加难以偿还外债――由此产生了今天的国际金融体系危险的不稳定状况。

虽然最优货币区理论并没有解释其中的任何问题，但是从推进全球化的观点看，这些问题却是阻碍发展的严重障碍。发展中国家的货币国家主义与这一过程的本质发生矛盾，因而使今后出现金融问题的可能性增大。

危机中的货币 为什么最近几十年来出现一系列货币危机的问题变得如此严重？只是从1971年，就是尼克松总统正式使美元与黄金脱钩的时候起，在全球四处流动的货币才不再是对任何实物的索取权。全世界的货币现在都是政府魔术般地变出的纯粹的主权表象。这种货币的绝大多数都是没人要的：人们不愿把它们当作财富，就是今后会起码像过去一样具有购买力的东西而持有。各国政府可以要求在与国家的交易中使用本国货币，从而迫使本国公民持有本国货币。但没有受到如此强迫的外国人则会选择不这样做。人们只愿意持有美元（和少量其它货币），作为黄金货币的替代物，在这样一个世界上，把货币与主权挂钩的神话是代价巨大的，有时还是危险的。货币国家主义就是与全球化不相容。即使这只是从20世纪70年代以来才变得明显，情况也一直都是这样。当时，全世界的政府都使本国货币丧失了内在的价值。

但是，作为货币学的逻辑与历史问题有悖常理，对全球化持批评意见的最著名的经济学家斯蒂格利茨热情支持了货币国家主义，作为对货币危机所造成的经济混乱的补救方法。当千百万人，包括本国人和外国人，由于担心即将发生的债务拖欠而抛售本国货币时，斯蒂格利茨的解决办法就是使本国货币与世界脱钩：降低利率、贬值、封锁金融流动，以及拒绝向借款人放贷等。恰恰是这种思维――朝着20世纪30年代的孤立主义的大倒退――乃是影响了现代全球化的危机周期的根源。

强势美元？ 对于像美国这样一个多样化的经济大国来说，浮动汇率在经济上相当于一场微不足道的牙痛。它们经常需要填充物――其形式为公司金融对冲和积极的全球供应管理――但却从未动过任何大手术。这有两个原因。其一，进口价格上涨时，美国人从国外购买的许多东西就可能会被国内生产迅速和廉价地取代。出口价格下跌时，他们在国外出售的许多东西就可能会被转移到国内市场。其次，外国人也乐于把美元当作财富持有。

对较小和比较落后的经济体来说，情况就不是这样。它们在增长，往往还有纯粹的生存方面依赖进口，但没有美元就不能为其付款。它们怎么办？就要收回它们据说被国际货币基金组织和国际市场夺走的主权，通过用美元替代没人要的本国货币（就像厄瓜多尔和萨尔瓦多5年前所作的那样），或者用欧元替代（波斯尼亚、科索沃和黑山的做法），从而一劳永逸地结束货币危机。就美元化所带来的好处来说，厄瓜多尔堪称楷模：这个陷入不断的政治动乱的国家却一直是经济稳定的堡垒，经济增长稳定而强劲，通胀率也是拉美最低的。无怪乎其新的左派总统拉斐尔・科雷亚不得不放弃其去美元化运动，以便争取选民的支持。把厄瓜多尔与多米尼加共和国加以对比。后者于2004年遭受了一场毁灭性的货币危机――一场不必要的危机，因为其85%的贸易都是与美国进行的（这个数字相当于美国一般的一个州与美国其它州之间贸易所占的百分比）。

人们经常争论说，只有对小国来说，美元化才是可行的。毫无疑问，国家小有助于使过渡简化。但是就连巴西经济也不到加利福尼亚的一半。美国联邦储备委员会对获取美元的更大需求可以毫无痛苦地（并在有利可图的情况下）做出妥协，而又不会以任何方式牺牲其对美国国内物价稳定所做出的承诺。美国政府如果是开明的话，就会在人们持有更多美元的时候退还它通过造币利差所获得的利润，从而使更多的国家在政治上实际上采用美元更加容易，代价也更小。（为了获得美元，实行美元化的国家把美国国库券等附带利息的资产送给美联储。对于这种资产，美国在其它情况下本来必须支付利息。）2000年的国际货币稳定法案本来会使这种退还成为美国官方的政策，但是这项立法在国会中夭折了，因为克林顿行政当局担心，它看上去会很像一项新的外援计划，因而没有予以支持。

波拉尼断言，由于人们永远也不会接受外国不兑现纸币，所以不兑现纸币永远也不能支持对外贸易。美元就是作为这样一种全球货币出现的 但是，作为今天的全球货币，美元的特权地位并非天赐。美元最终仅仅是通过信用支持的另外一种货币。而其它国家今后之所以愿意接受它，是为了换取与它过去所买到的东西不相上下的有价值的物品。这样一来，就使美国政府机构承担了巨大的负担，必须证明这种信用的合法性。不幸的是，这些机构未能承担这一负担。不顾后果的美国财政政策正在削弱美元的地位，甚至在美元作为全球货币的作用不断扩大的时候也是如此。

40年前，就在布雷顿森林以美元为基础的金汇兑本位崩溃前几年，法国著名经济学家雅克・吕埃夫写道，这个体系“达到了如此荒诞的程度，以致有推理能力的任何人脑都无法为其辩解。”今天，美元风雨飘摇的地位是类似的。美国能够维持长期的国际收支逆差，而始终不会感觉到其影响。汇到国外的美元立即就会以贷款的形式，就是作为在国外毫无用途的美元回到国内。吕埃夫打比喻解释说：“如果我与我的裁缝达成协议，不管我付给他多少钱，他都当天就当作一笔贷款归还给我，我对从他那里订购更多的西装就不会持任何反对意见。”

由于美国的经常项目逆差达到占GDP6.6%这一巨额数字（为了维持它，每天必须输入大约20亿美元），所以美国处于一种值得庆幸的地位，就是成为中国裁缝的西装买主，而中国裁缝则立即以贷款形式――在美国的情况中一般就是购买美国国库券――退还了买主的付款。出现经常项目逆差在一定程度上是由于受到预算赤字的刺激（后者每增加1美元，就会使前者大约增加20美分到50美分）。由于缺乏改革来限制寿命更长的人口的医疗保健和养老金方面的联邦政府“应得权利”开支，所以在今后10年里，预算赤字将会猛增。因此，美国――实际上还有其中国裁缝――都必须关注吕埃夫所说的一件“荒诞事”的可持续性。由于缺乏财政上的长期审慎，美国冒着削弱外国人对其管理美元的方式所给予的信任――就是相信美国政府能够继续维持低通胀率，而又不必诉诸压垮经济增长的利率大幅度提高，以此作为确保资本大量流入的途径――的风险。

货币私营化 普遍的假设是，作为全球货币，美元的天然替代物是欧元。然而，人们对欧元的持久性的信心仍是脆弱的――袭击了美元的财政上的担忧也削弱了这种信心，但也有一种额外的不安，因为人们对意大利等国所面临的恢复货币国家主义的诱惑感到担忧。但还有一项替代选择，乃是世界上货币的最持久形式：黄金。

必须强调的是，管理得当的不兑现纸币体系与基于商品的纸币相比，具有相当大的优势，尤其是它不浪费宝贵的资源。如果从南非挖掘黄金，却在美国诺克斯堡将其重新埋掉，就没有什么可以褒奖之处。问题是在美国，这样一个管理得当的不兑现纸币体系能够维持多久。国家货币可以追溯到2500多年以前的历史记录基本上是糟糕的。

19世纪和20世纪交替之际――金本位的高潮时期――西梅尔评论说：“虽然在理想的社会秩序中，毫无内在价值的货币会是交换的最佳手段，但在达到这一点之前，最令人满意的货币形式则可能是与一种实物相联系的。”今天，由于货币不再与任何实物相联系，所以值得一问的是，世界是否哪怕是接近这种“理想的社会秩序”，就是可以维持一种不兑现美元，作为全球金融体系的基础。如果拥有1万亿美元以上的外汇储备的中国和持有大量美元的另外一些国家担心自己所持有货币令人无法忍受的无足轻重，那么就没有办法可以有效地防范全球失衡的出现。

那么黄金如何呢？恢复金本位根本谈不上。19世纪时，各国政府在一年中花费的国民收入还不到10%。今天，它们经常花掉一半或者更多。因此，它们永远也不会使开支服从于维持一个基于商品的货币体系的严格要求。但私营的黄金银行已经存在，从而使账户的持有者可以用真实的金条作为股份的形式，进行国际支付。虽然黄金银行业目前显然是小本生意，但随着美元的衰落，它近年来有了显著的增长。如果谈论一种基于黄金的新的国际货币体系，肯定听起来很离谱。但1900年时，一个没有黄金的货币体系也是如此。现代科技使得通过私营黄金银行恢复黄金货币成为可能，即使没有政府的支持也是如此。

通用货币 几百年来，几乎每一项反对全球化的最新重大论点都是针对市场的普遍论点（并逐一被抛弃）。但在拥有150种浮动的国家不兑现纸币的世界上，反对资本流动的论点却根本不同。它很有说服力――以致就连全球化的最坚决的支持者也把资本流动当作一个例外，当作知识领域中要加以隔离的东西――一直到能够开发出防范危机的有效疫苗为止――来对待。但是，认为资本的流动具有内在的破坏稳定性，这一观念在逻辑上和历史上却是谬误。必须重温19世纪基于黄金的全球化的教训。纽约和加州是世界上最大的12个经济体当中的两个。正如它们之间每天的巨额资本流动十分平常，以致甚至于无人注意到一样，共享一种货币，譬如美元或欧元的各国之间的资本流动也甚至没有引起最激烈地反对全球化的积极分子们的丝毫注意。

其货币仍然遭到外国人厌恶的各国将继续对预防危机的政策进行试验，实行资本控制和建立美元储备的武库。很少有哪个国家会重复阿根廷失败的努力，即在没有美元协同动作的情况下采取盯住美元的汇率。如果这些政策再让国际货币基金组织烦恼上几年，会很有益处。

但是，世人可以做得更好。由于全球化进程以外的经济发展不再有可能，所以各国应当用美元或欧元取代本国货币，或者在亚洲的情况中，进行协作，以形成一种在具有相应幅员与经济多样化的地区内流通的新的多国货币。

欧洲人过去常说，作为一个国家，必须拥有国家的航空公司、股票交易所和货币。今天却没有任何欧洲国家因没有这些东西而境况变得更糟。就连坏脾气的意大利也由于伴随着采用欧元而来的较低利率和永远结束了里拉投机而受益匪浅。今后如果实行一种按照与此相同的以很低的和稳定的通胀率为目标的原则加以管理的全亚洲范围的货币，会是最有希望的途径，可以使中国全面实行金融和资本市场自由化，而又不用担心会出现人民币造成破坏的投机（中国经济只有加州和佛罗里达州经济加在一起的大小）。世界上大多数较小和比较贫困的国家如果单方面采用美元或者欧元显然都是上策，因为这样会使它们得以安全和迅速地融入到全球金融市场之中。拉美各国应当实行美元化；东欧各国和土耳其则应实行欧元化。广泛而言，这一处方所遵循的原则是相对的贸易流动，但是也有例外。例如，阿根廷在欧元区的贸易就比与美国之间的贸易要多。但是阿根廷人在理财和储蓄方面却采用美元。

当然，实行美元化的各国必须放弃独立的货币政策，不再把它当作政府宏观经济管理的一项工具。但是，由于货币政策长期而艰难的追求的目标，是使利率降低到与很低和稳定的通胀率相一致的最低的水平，所以对世界上大多数国家来说，以此为依据反对实行美元化的论点都是轻浮的。有多少拉美国家能够把利率降低到低于美国利率的水平呢？拉美平均扣除通胀因素以后的贷款利率为20%左右。因此必须问一问，凭借在自行斟酌的基础上指导本国的名义利率上下浮动的能力，发展中国家的中央银行可望在多大程度上促进本国的经济增长？这就像选择一辆安装着手动传送装置的现代牌汽车，而放弃具有自动

1906年6月30日 美国颁布确保食品和药品纯洁性法案

1906年6月30日，美国总统西奥多-罗斯福批准了一项议案，保证美国人所用的食品和药品的纯洁性。这是1906年对掺假商品的第二次严厉限制。

这项新法律将于1907年1月1日生效。它规定：禁止商品贴假商标，禁止在美国国内制造和运输掺假食品和药品。5月，在总统的敦促下，国会通过立法，要求所有供人食用的肉类产品在包装运输之前必须经过检查。

罗斯福第一次对肉的问题感兴趣是在他读了厄普顿-辛克莱的《丛林》一书之后，这本书揭露了芝加哥包装厂的肮脏状况。辛克莱叙述了屠宰场宰杀病畜，操作工人肮脏不堪，厂内老鼠四处乱窜的情景。起初总统对作者的描述持怀疑态度。后来他同辛克莱对此交换意见，并在最后确信书中的描写是真实可信的之后，总统极力主张建立一项肉食检查法。

根据这项新通过的食品药品纯洁法规的规定，被发现使用假冒商标，或者在食品或药品中掺假的违法者，将被罚500美元或者受到一年的监禁，或者同时受到以上两种处罚。这项法规涉及的食品包括人和牲畜食用的所有食物、饮料和调味品。

The End of National Currency

By Benn Steil From Foreign Affairs, May/June 2007 http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20070501faessay86308/benn-steil/the-end-of-national-currency.html?mode=print 

Summary: Global financial instability has sparked a surge in "monetary nationalism" -- the idea that countries must make and control their own currencies. But globalization and monetary nationalism are a dangerous combination, a cause of financial crises and geopolitical tension. The world needs to abandon unwanted currencies, replacing them with dollars, euros, and multinational currencies as yet unborn.  

Benn Steil is Director of International Economics at the Council on Foreign Relations and a co-author of Financial Statecraft.  

THE RISE OF MONETARY NATIONALISM  

Capital flows have become globalization's Achilles' heel. Over the past 25 years, devastating currency crises have hit countries across Latin America and Asia, as well as countries just beyond the borders of western Europe -- most notably Russia and Turkey. Even such an impeccably credentialed pro-globalization economist as U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Frederic Mishkin has acknowledged that "opening up the financial system to foreign capital flows has led to some disastrous financial crises causing great pain, suffering, and even violence."  

The economics profession has failed to offer anything resembling a coherent and compelling response to currency crises. International Monetary Fund (IMF) analysts have, over the past two decades, endorsed a wide variety of national exchange-rate and monetary policy regimes that have subsequently collapsed in failure. They have fingered numerous culprits, from loose fiscal policy and poor bank regulation to bad industrial policy and official corruption. The financial-crisis literature has yielded policy recommendations so exquisitely hedged and widely contradicted as to be practically useless.  

Antiglobalization economists have turned the problem on its head by absolving governments (except the one in Washington) and instead blaming crises on markets and their institutional supporters, such as the IMF -- "dictatorships of international finance," in the words of the Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz. "Countries are effectively told that if they don't follow certain conditions, the capital markets or the IMF will refuse to lend them money," writes Stiglitz. "They are basically forced to give up part of their sovereignty."  

Is this right? Are markets failing, and will restoring lost sovereignty to governments put an end to financial instability? This is a dangerous misdiagnosis. In fact, capital flows became destabilizing only after countries began asserting "sovereignty" over money -- detaching it from gold or anything else considered real wealth. Moreover, even if the march of globalization is not inevitable, the world economy and the international financial system have evolved in such a way that there is no longer a viable model for economic development outside of them.  

The right course is not to return to a mythical past of monetary sovereignty, with governments controlling local interest and exchange rates in blissful ignorance of the rest of the world. Governments must let go of the fatal notion that nationhood requires them to make and control the money used in their territory. National currencies and global markets simply do not mix; together they make a deadly brew of currency crises and geopolitical tension and create ready pretexts for damaging protectionism. In order to globalize safely, countries should abandon monetary nationalism and abolish unwanted currencies, the source of much of today's instability.  

THE GOLDEN AGE  

Capital flows were enormous, even by contemporary standards, during the last great period of "globalization," from the late nineteenth century to the outbreak of World War I. Currency crises occurred during this period, but they were generally shallow and short-lived. That is because money was then -- as it has been throughout most of the world and most of human history -- gold, or at least a credible claim on gold. Funds flowed quickly back to crisis countries because of confidence that the gold link would be restored. At the time, monetary nationalism was considered a sign of backwardness, adherence to a universally acknowledged standard of value a mark of civilization.  

Those nations that adhered most reliably (such as Australia, Canada, and the United States) were rewarded with the lowest international borrowing rates. Those that adhered the least (such as Argentina, Brazil, and Chile) were punished with the highest. This bond was fatally severed during the period between World War I and World War II. Most economists in the 1930s and 1940s considered it obvious that capital flows would become destabilizing with the end of reliably fixed exchange rates.  

Friedrich Hayek noted in a 1937 lecture that under a credible gold-standard regime, "short-term capital movements will on the whole tend to relieve the strain set up by the original cause of a temporarily adverse balance of payments. If exchanges, however, are variable, the capital movements will tend to work in the same direction as the original cause and thereby to intensify it" -- as they do today.  

The belief that globalization required hard money, something foreigners would willingly hold, was widespread. The French economist Charles Rist observed that "while the theorizers are trying to persuade the public and the various governments that a minimum quantity of gold ... would suffice to maintain monetary confidence, and that anyhow paper currency, even fiat currency, would amply meet all needs, the public in all countries is busily hoarding all the national currencies which are supposed to be convertible into gold."  

This view was hardly limited to free marketeers. As notable a critic of the gold standard and global capitalism as Karl Polanyi took it as obvious that monetary nationalism was incompatible with globalization. Focusing on the United Kingdom's interest in growing world trade in the nineteenth century, he argued that "nothing else but commodity money could serve this end for the obvious reason that token money, whether bank or fiat, cannot circulate on foreign soil."  

Yet what Polanyi considered nonsensical -- global trade in goods, services, and capital intermediated by intrinsically worthless national paper (or "fiat") monies -- is exactly how globalization is advancing, ever so fitfully, today.  

The political mythology associating the creation and control of money with national sovereignty finds its economic counterpart in the metamorphosis of the famous theory of "optimum currency areas" (OCA). Fathered in 1961 by Robert Mundell, a Nobel Prize-winning economist who has long been a prolific advocate of shrinking the number of national currencies, it became over the subsequent decades a quasi-scientific foundation for monetary nationalism.  

Mundell, like most macroeconomists of the early 1960s, had a now largely discredited postwar Keynesian mindset that put great faith in the ability of policymakers to fine-tune national demand in the face of what economists call "shocks" to supply and demand. His seminal article, "A Theory of Optimum Currency Areas," asks the question, "What is the appropriate domain of the currency area?"  

"It might seem at first that the question is purely academic," he observes, "since it hardly appears within the realm of political feasibility that national currencies would ever be abandoned in favor of any other arrangement." Mundell goes on to argue for flexible exchange rates between regions of the world, each with its own multinational currency, rather than between nations.  

The economics profession, however, latched on to Mundell's analysis of the merits of flexible exchange rates in dealing with economic shocks affecting different "regions or countries" differently; they saw it as a rationale for treating existing nations as natural currency areas. Monetary nationalism thereby acquired a rational scientific mooring. And from then on, much of the mainstream economics profession came to see deviations from "one nation, one currency" as misguided, at least in the absence of prior political integration.  

The link between money and nationhood having been established by economists (much in the way that Aristotle and Jesus were reconciled by medieval scholastics), governments adopted OCA theory as the primary intellectual defense of monetary nationalism. Brazilian central bankers have even defended the country's monetary independence by publicly appealing to OCA theory -- against Mundell himself, who spoke out on the economic damage that sky-high interest rates (the result of maintaining unstable national monies that no one wants to hold) impose on Latin American countries.  

Indeed, much of Latin America has already experienced "spontaneous dollarization": despite restrictions in many countries, U.S. dollars represent over 50 percent of bank deposits. (In Uruguay, the figure is 90 percent, reflecting the appeal of Uruguay's lack of currency restrictions and its famed bank secrecy.) This increasingly global phenomenon of people rejecting national monies as a store of wealth has no place in OCA theory.

NO TURNING BACK  Just a few decades ago, vital foreign investment in developing countries was driven by two main motivations: to extract raw materials for export and to gain access to local markets heavily protected against competition from imports. Attracting the first kind of investment was simple for countries endowed with the right natural resources. (Companies readily went into war zones to extract oil, for example.) Governments pulled in the second kind of investment by erecting tariff and other barriers to competition so as to compensate foreigners for an otherwise unappealing business climate. Foreign investors brought money and know-how in return for monopolies in the domestic market.

This cozy scenario was undermined by the advent of globalization. Trade liberalization has opened up most developing countries to imports (in return for export access to developed countries), and huge declines in the costs of communication and transport have revolutionized the economics of global production and distribution. Accordingly, the reasons for foreign companies to invest in developing countries have changed. The desire to extract commodities remains, but companies generally no longer need to invest for the sake of gaining access to domestic markets. It is generally not necessary today to produce in a country in order to sell in it (except in large economies such as Brazil and China).

At the same time, globalization has produced a compelling new reason to invest in developing countries: to take advantage of lower production costs by integrating local facilities into global chains of production and distribution. Now that markets are global rather than local, countries compete with others for investment, and the factors defining an attractive investment climate have changed dramatically. Countries can no longer attract investors by protecting them against competition; now, since protection increases the prices of goods that foreign investors need as production inputs, it actually reduces global competitiveness.

In a globalizing economy, monetary stability and access to sophisticated financial services are essential components of an attractive local investment climate. And in this regard, developing countries are especially poorly positioned. Traditionally, governments in the developing world exercised strict control over interest rates, loan maturities, and even the beneficiaries of credit -- all of which required severing financial and monetary links with the rest of the world and tightly controlling international capital flows.

As a result, such flows occurred mainly to settle trade imbalances or fund direct investments, and local financial systems remained weak and underdeveloped. But growth today depends more and more on investment decisions funded and funneled through the global financial system. (Borrowing in low-cost yen to finance investments in Europe while hedging against the yen's rise on a U.S. futures exchange is no longer exotic.) Thus, unrestricted and efficient access to this global system -- rather than the ability of governments to manipulate parochial monetary policies -- has become essential for future economic development.

But because foreigners are often unwilling to hold the currencies of developing countries, those countries' local financial systems end up being largely isolated from the global system. Their interest rates tend to be much higher than those in the international markets and their lending operations extremely short -- not longer than a few months in most cases. As a result, many developing countries are dependent on U.S. dollars for long-term credit. This is what makes capital flows, however necessary, dangerous: in a developing country, both locals and foreigners will sell off the local currency en masse at the earliest whiff of devaluation, since devaluation makes it more difficult for the country to pay its foreign debts -- hence the dangerous instability of today's international financial system.

Although OCA theory accounts for none of these problems, they are grave obstacles to development in the context of advancing globalization. Monetary nationalism in developing countries operates against the grain of the process -- and thus makes future financial problems even more likely.

MONEY IN CRISIS  Why has the problem of serial currency crises become so severe in recent decades? It is only since 1971, when President Richard Nixon formally untethered the dollar from gold, that monies flowing around the globe have ceased to be claims on anything real. All the world's currencies are now pure manifestations of sovereignty conjured by governments. And the vast majority of such monies are unwanted: people are unwilling to hold them as wealth, something that will buy in the future at least what it did in the past.

Governments can force their citizens to hold national money by requiring its use in transactions with the state, but foreigners, who are not thus compelled, will choose not to do so. And in a world in which people will only willingly hold dollars (and a handful of other currencies) in lieu of gold money, the mythology tying money to sovereignty is a costly and sometimes dangerous one. Monetary nationalism is simply incompatible with globalization. It has always been, even if this has only become apparent since the 1970s, when all the world's governments rendered their currencies intrinsically worthless.

Yet, perversely as a matter of both monetary logic and history, the most notable economist critical of globalization, Stiglitz, has argued passionately for monetary nationalism as the remedy for the economic chaos caused by currency crises. When millions of people, locals and foreigners, are selling a national currency for fear of an impending default, the Stiglitz solution is for the issuing government to simply decouple from the world: drop interest rates, devalue, close off financial flows, and stiff the lenders. It is precisely this thinking, a throwback to the isolationism of the 1930s, that is at the root of the cycle of crisis that has infected modern globalization.

Argentina has become the poster child for monetary nationalists -- those who believe that every country should have its own paper currency and not waste resources hoarding gold or hard-currency reserves. Monetary nationalists advocate capital controls to avoid entanglement with foreign creditors. But they cannot stop there. As Hayek emphasized in his 1937 lecture, "exchange control designed to prevent effectively the outflow of capital would really have to involve a complete control of foreign trade," since capital movements are triggered by changes in the terms of credit on exports and imports.

Indeed, this is precisely the path that Argentina has followed since 2002, when the government abandoned its currency board, which tried to fix the peso to the dollar without the dollars necessary to do so. Since writing off $80 billion worth of its debts (75 percent in nominal terms), the Argentine government has been resorting to ever more intrusive means in order to prevent its citizens from protecting what remains of their savings and buying from or selling to foreigners. The country has gone straight back to the statist model of economic control that has failed Latin America repeatedly over generations.

The government has steadily piled on more and more onerous capital and domestic price controls, export taxes, export bans, and limits on citizens' access to foreign currency. Annual inflation has nevertheless risen to about 20 percent, prompting the government to make ham-fisted efforts to manipulate the official price data. The economy has become ominously dependent on soybean production, which surged in the wake of price controls and export bans on cattle, taking the country back to the pre-globalization model of reliance on a single commodity export for hard-currency earnings. Despite many years of robust postcrisis economic recovery, GDP is still, in constant U.S. dollars, 26 percent below its peak in 1998, and the country's long-term economic future looks as fragile as ever.

When currency crises hit, countries need dollars to pay off creditors. That is when their governments turn to the IMF, the most demonized institutional face of globalization. The IMF has been attacked by Stiglitz and others for violating "sovereign rights" in imposing conditions in return for loans. Yet the sort of compromises on policy autonomy that sovereign borrowers strike today with the IMF were in the past struck directly with foreign governments. And in the nineteenth century, these compromises cut far more deeply into national autonomy.

Historically, throughout the Balkans and Latin America, sovereign borrowers subjected themselves to considerable foreign control, at times enduring what were considered to be egregious blows to independence. Following its recognition as a state in 1832, Greece spent the rest of the century under varying degrees of foreign creditor control; on the heels of a default on its 1832 obligations, the country had its entire finances placed under French administration. In order to return to the international markets after 1878, the country had to precommit specific revenues from customs and state monopolies to debt repayment.

An 1887 loan gave its creditors the power to create a company that would supervise the revenues committed to repayment. After a disastrous war with Turkey over Crete in 1897, Greece was obliged to accept a control commission, comprised entirely of representatives of the major powers, that had absolute power over the sources of revenue necessary to fund its war debt. Greece's experience was mirrored in Bulgaria, Serbia, the Ottoman Empire, Egypt, and, of course, Argentina.

There is, in short, no age of monetary sovereignty to return to. Countries have always borrowed, and when offered the choice between paying high interest rates to compensate for default risk (which was typical during the Renaissance) and paying lower interest rates in return for sacrificing some autonomy over their ability to default (which was typical in the nineteenth century), they have commonly chosen the latter. As for the notion that the IMF today possesses some extraordinary power over the exchange-rate policies of borrowing countries, this, too, is historically inaccurate.

Adherence to the nineteenth-century gold standard, with the Bank of England at the helm of the system, severely restricted national monetary autonomy, yet governments voluntarily subjected themselves to it precisely because it meant cheaper capital and greater trade opportunities.

THE MIGHTY DOLLAR?  For a large, diversified economy like that of the United States, fluctuating exchange rates are the economic equivalent of a minor toothache. They require fillings from time to time -- in the form of corporate financial hedging and active global supply management -- but never any major surgery. There are two reasons for this. First, much of what Americans buy from abroad can, when import prices rise, quickly and cheaply be replaced by domestic production, and much of what they sell abroad can, when export prices fall, be diverted to the domestic market. Second, foreigners are happy to hold U.S. dollars as wealth.

This is not so for smaller and less advanced economies. They depend on imports for growth, and often for sheer survival, yet cannot pay for them without dollars. What can they do? Reclaim the sovereignty they have allegedly lost to the IMF and international markets by replacing the unwanted national currency with dollars (as Ecuador and El Salvador did half a decade ago) or euros (as Bosnia, Kosovo, and Montenegro did) and thereby end currency crises for good. Ecuador is the shining example of the benefits of dollarization: a country in constant political turmoil has been a bastion of economic stability, with steady, robust economic growth and the lowest inflation rate in Latin America.

No wonder its new leftist president, Rafael Correa, was obliged to ditch his de-dollarization campaign in order to win over the electorate. Contrast Ecuador with the Dominican Republic, which suffered a devastating currency crisis in 2004 -- a needless crisis, as 85 percent of its trade is conducted with the United States (a figure comparable to the percentage of a typical U.S. state's trade with other U.S. states).

It is often argued that dollarization is only feasible for small countries. No doubt, smallness makes for a simpler transition. But even Brazil's economy is less than half the size of California's, and the U.S. Federal Reserve could accommodate the increased demand for dollars painlessly (and profitably) without in any way sacrificing its commitment to U.S. domestic price stability. An enlightened U.S. government would actually make it politically easier and less costly for more countries to adopt the dollar by rebating the seigniorage profits it earns when people hold more dollars. (To get dollars, dollarizing countries give the Federal Reserve interest-bearing assets, such as Treasury bonds, which the United States would otherwise have to pay interest on.)

The International Monetary Stability Act of 2000 would have made such rebates official U.S. policy, but the legislation died in Congress, unsupported by a Clinton administration that feared it would look like a new foreign-aid program.

Polanyi was wrong when he claimed that because people would never accept foreign fiat money, fiat money could never support foreign trade. The dollar has emerged as just such a global money. This phenomenon was actually foreseen by the brilliant German philosopher and sociologist Georg Simmel in 1900. He surmised:

Expanding economic relations eventually produce in the enlarged, and finally international, circle the same features that originally characterized only closed groups; economic and legal conditions overcome the spatial separation more and more, and they come to operate just as reliably, precisely and predictably over a great distance as they did previously in local communities.

To the extent that this happens, the pledge, that is the intrinsic value of the money, can be reduced. ... Even though we are still far from having a close and reliable relationship within or between nations, the trend is undoubtedly in that direction.

But the dollar's privileged status as today's global money is not heaven-bestowed. The dollar is ultimately just another money supported only by faith that others will willingly accept it in the future in return for the same sort of valuable things it bought in the past. This puts a great burden on the institutions of the U.S. government to validate that faith. And those institutions, unfortunately, are failing to shoulder that burden. Reckless U.S. fiscal policy is undermining the dollar's position even as the currency's role as a global money is expanding.

Four decades ago, the renowned French economist Jacques Rueff, writing just a few years before the collapse of the Bretton Woods dollar-based gold-exchange standard, argued that the system "attains such a degree of absurdity that no human brain having the power to reason can defend it." The precariousness of the dollar's position today is similar. The United States can run a chronic balance-of-payments deficit and never feel the effects. Dollars sent abroad immediately come home in the form of loans, as dollars are of no use abroad. "If I had an agreement with my tailor that whatever money I pay him he returns to me the very same day as a loan," Rueff explained by way of analogy, "I would have no objection at all to ordering more suits from him."

With the U.S. current account deficit running at an enormous 6.6 percent of GDP (about $2 billion a day must be imported to sustain it), the United States is in the fortunate position of the suit buyer with a Chinese tailor who instantaneously returns his payments in the form of loans -- generally, in the U.S. case, as purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds. The current account deficit is partially fueled by the budget deficit (a dollar more of the latter yields about 20-50 cents more of the former), which will soar in the next decade in the absence of reforms to curtail federal "entitlement" spending on medical care and retirement benefits for a longer-living population.

The United States -- and, indeed, its Chinese tailor -- must therefore be concerned with the sustainability of what Rueff called an "absurdity." In the absence of long-term fiscal prudence, the United States risks undermining the faith foreigners have placed in its management of the dollar -- that is, their belief that the U.S. government can continue to sustain low inflation without having to resort to growth-crushing interest-rate hikes as a means of ensuring continued high capital inflows.

PRIVATIZING MONEY

It is widely assumed that the natural alternative to the dollar as a global currency is the euro. Faith in the euro's endurance, however, is still fragile -- undermined by the same fiscal concerns that afflict the dollar but with the added angst stemming from concerns about the temptations faced by Italy and others to return to monetary nationalism. But there is another alternative, the world's most enduring form of money: gold.

It must be stressed that a well-managed fiat money system has considerable advantages over a commodity-based one, not least of which that it does not waste valuable resources. There is little to commend in digging up gold in South Africa just to bury it again in Fort Knox. The question is how long such a well-managed fiat system can endure in the United States. The historical record of national monies, going back over 2,500 years, is by and large awful.

At the turn of the twentieth century -- the height of the gold standard -- Simmel commented, "Although money with no intrinsic value would be the best means of exchange in an ideal social order, until that point is reached the most satisfactory form of money may be that which is bound to a material substance." Today, with money no longer bound to any material substance, it is worth asking whether the world even approximates the "ideal social order" that could sustain a fiat dollar as the foundation of the global financial system. There is no way effectively to insure against the unwinding of global imbalances should China, with over a trillion dollars of reserves, and other countries with dollar-rich central banks come to fear the unbearable lightness of their holdings.

So what about gold? A revived gold standard is out of the question. In the nineteenth century, governments spent less than ten percent of national income in a given year. Today, they routinely spend half or more, and so they would never subordinate spending to the stringent requirements of sustaining a commodity-based monetary system. But private gold banks already exist, allowing account holders to make international payments in the form of shares in actual gold bars. Although clearly a niche business at present, gold banking has grown dramatically in recent years, in tandem with the dollar's decline.

A new gold-based international monetary system surely sounds far-fetched. But so, in 1900, did a monetary system without gold. Modern technology makes a revival of gold money, through private gold banks, possible even without government support.

COMMON CURRENCIES

Virtually every major argument recently leveled against globalization has been leveled against markets generally (and, in turn, debunked) for hundreds of years. But the argument against capital flows in a world with 150 fluctuating national fiat monies is fundamentally different. It is highly compelling -- so much so that even globalization's staunchest supporters treat capital flows as an exception, a matter to be intellectually quarantined until effective crisis inoculations can be developed. But the notion that capital flows are inherently destabilizing is logically and historically false. The lessons of gold-based globalization in the nineteenth century simply must be relearned.

Just as the prodigious daily capital flows between New York and California, two of the world's 12 largest economies, are so uneventful that no one even notices them, capital flows between countries sharing a single currency, such as the dollar or the euro, attract not the slightest attention from even the most passionate antiglobalization activists. Countries whose currencies remain unwanted by foreigners will continue to experiment with crisis-prevention policies, imposing capital controls and building up war chests of dollar reserves. Few will repeat Argentina's misguided efforts to fix a dollar exchange rate without the dollars to do so. If these policies keep the IMF bored for a few more years, they will be for the good.

But the world can do better. Since economic development outside the process of globalization is no longer possible, countries should abandon monetary nationalism. Governments should replace national currencies with the dollar or the euro or, in the case of Asia, collaborate to produce a new multinational currency over a comparably large and economically diversified area.

Europeans used to say that being a country required having a national airline, a stock exchange, and a currency. Today, no European country is any worse off without them. Even grumpy Italy has benefited enormously from the lower interest rates and permanent end to lira speculation that accompanied its adoption of the euro. A future pan-Asian currency, managed according to the same principle of targeting low and stable inflation, would represent the most promising way for China to fully liberalize its financial and capital markets without fear of damaging renminbi speculation (the Chinese economy is only the size of California's and Florida's combined).

Most of the world's smaller and poorer countries would clearly be best off unilaterally adopting the dollar or the euro, which would enable their safe and rapid integration into global financial markets. Latin American countries should dollarize; eastern European countries and Turkey, euroize. Broadly speaking, this prescription follows from relative trade flows, but there are exceptions; Argentina, for example, does more eurozone than U.S. trade, but Argentines think and save in dollars.

Of course, dollarizing countries must give up independent monetary policy as a tool of government macroeconomic management. But since the Holy Grail of monetary policy is to get interest rates down to the lowest level consistent with low and stable inflation, an argument against dollarization on this ground is, for most of the world, frivolous. How many Latin American countries can cut interest rates below those in the United States? The average inflation-adjusted lending rate in Latin America is about 20 percent. One must therefore ask what possible boon to the national economy developing-country central banks can hope to achieve from the ability to guide nominal local rates up and down on a discretionary basis. It is like choosing a Hyundai with manual transmission over a Lexus with automatic: the former gives the driver more control but at the cost of inferior performance under any condition.

As for the United States, it needs to perpetuate the sound money policies of former Federal Reserve Chairs Paul Volcker and Alan Greenspan and return to long-term fiscal discipline. This is the only sure way to keep the United States' foreign tailors, with their massive and growing holdings of dollar debt, feeling wealthy and secure. It is the market that made the dollar into global money -- and what the market giveth, the market can taketh away. If the tailors balk and the dollar fails, the market may privatize money on its own.
